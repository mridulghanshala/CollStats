There is very little, if any, party atmosphere (most you'll find is a collection of kids imbibing on alcohol to get over the work grind). If you want to learn at a top-tier school, CMU is definitely there; if you want to converse with \"socially\" normal humans, take a stroll to the University of Pittsburgh xD!<br/>\nAlong the lines of Freshman workload, in the Biology department(my brother), he felt ahead of/up to date with his previous knowledge, 5's on AP BIO/CHEM exams, etc. After freshman year, I couldn't help you there, since he switched to engineering/business.<br/>\n<br/>\nI personally decided not to attend (whether or not accepted) due to the fact of the 4 year \"grind\" required to succeed(I want to go to med school aka gpa is tough to keep very high) and the mountain of debt that anyone who is not below ~50k nor above 150k will certainly carry for a long time (brother is graduating with ~240k debt, my parents make ~75k)<br/>\n<br/>\nSo, all in all, if you are looking for an academically rigorous school, and you are not intimidated by debt, CMU is definitely a good school for you. If you are kind of so-so on the idea of attending, think about what you want to do, and if CMU can truly help you achieve that goal (more than likely they can). Then consider your other options with the resources they provide and go from there!<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/20353963/#Comment_20353963\" name=\"Item_1\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2017-03-01T04:39:41+00:00\" title=\"March  1, 2017 12:39AM\">March 2017</time></a></span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">0</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F1964956%2Fwhat-is-the-culture-like-at-carnegie-mellon%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=20353963\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

There's a lot you already can't change: your GPA, extracurriculars, your ethnicity...but here are the things you can do.<br/>\n<br/>\n-Make sure you meet all the SAT requirements. As a CIT applicant, you'll have to take Math 2 and Physics/Chem beyond SATs/ACTs. (Just covering the basics.)<br/>\n-Show demonstrated interest. On the Common Data Set it says demonstrated interest is \"Important,\" so I'm guessing CMU is one of those schools that have a record on who contacts them (don't quote me on this), etc... There are tons of ways to show interest. If you can afford it, sign up for an interview, take a campus tour. Sometimes even sending an email asking a well-thought out question can do it. (What I did. Cause I actually had a question; don't do it just to send an email.)<br/>\n-In you Common App Essay and Why CMU, show interest and be nerdy! Everyone I've met at CMU, esp the engineers are nerdy af. Not exactly in the antisocial and quiet way, but in a passionate about technology way. Both my essays were heavily drawn on projects I've did.<br/>\n-Have a central theme, especially in your Why CMU essay. I think the Why CMU supplement was the most important part of why I was accepted, because I was able to articulate why I liked CMU and why it would be a great place for me to learn.<br/>\n-Do your research. Cite specific things you would like to get involved in, but don't bombard them with a gigantic list of things you would like to be part of. Have a reason why you choose each and every one of what you want to do.<br/>\n<br/>\nBonus points: People say that engineers don't have great social skills. To some degree it's true, so having a well-written and focused answers will help. CMU is a wonderful engineering school that recognizes the importance of writing/communication, esp. in tech.<br/>\n<br/>\nDisclaimer: I'm not an adcom. This is just my take on applying to CIT, after reflecting on my own application and my friends' that applied. Hopefully it helped. Relax and take your time on the essays.<br/>\n<br/>\nDon't worry about the things you can't change! Good Luck!<br/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/19854096/#Comment_19854096\" name=\"Item_13\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2016-08-05T02:32:34+00:00\" title=\"August  4, 2016 10:32PM\">August 2016</time></a></span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">4</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F1903464%2Fcarnegie-mellon-class-of-2021-applicants-discussion-thread%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=19854096\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

I figure it must come down to something really specific in the application process, though, because I feel like I was a pretty good applicant....<br/>\n<br/>\nDecision: Waitlisted (CIT)<br/>\n<br/>\nDemographics: white male, public high school, middle-class area, though for some reason no one in my large high school tends to go to Ivies, and only a few go to top colleges.<br/>\n<br/>\nACT/SAT:<br/>\nMath: 800/Reading: 790<br/>\nMath II: 800<br/>\nPhysics: 780 (I was only able to take AP Physics 1 at my school, so that was bad)<br/>\n<br/>\nGrades: 4.00 UW / 4.6 W, top 2% of class (weighted GPA brought down by having 8 orchestra classes)<br/>\n<br/>\nAP scores:<br/>\nAP Calculus AB (5)<br/>\nAP World History (4)<br/>\nAP Statistics (5)<br/>\nAP Calculus BC (5)<br/>\nAP English Language &amp; Composition (5)<br/>\nAP Physics 1 (5)<br/>\n<br/>\nCurrent schedule: AP Gov, AP Econ (Micro), AP Literature (also dual enrollment Composition 101), Symphony Orchestra, a smaller ensemble orchestra, APUSH, AP Chemistry<br/>\n<br/>\nActivities:<br/>\nOrchestra (captain of smaller ensemble -&gt; co-president)<br/>\nRobotics (Vice President -&gt; president)<br/>\nA year of chess club, various volunteering related to demonstrating and helping to teach robotics to elementary school kids, helping to work with Chromebooks at our HS. About 200 hours of volunteering recorded, probably 300ish in total.<br/>\nHonors: Two robotics state championships (over a dozen tournaments won, plus a smattering of other awards), National Merit Finalist, individual and group awards for orchestra (we went to perform at Carnegie Hall).<br/>\n<br/>\nLetters of rec: These might have been weak just because I really do not like asking anything of other people on their own time, especially our severely underpaid teachers. I got an amazing recommendation from our robotics mentor, and pretty good recommendations from English and Math teachers. (Those could have been better if I had made suggestions and asked for more details, which I regret not doing.)<br/>\n<br/>\nEssays:<br/>\nCommon App - wrote about having to pick up the pieces of the robotics team after almost everyone graduated (team is largely student-led) and applying a standard of excellence to everything we do. Really, robotics was my focus in high school, so this is something I was passionate about being the best at. It's a small team, and I led the design of the robot and did the programming and driving.<br/>\nWhy CMU - I wrote about how I wanted to participate in the solar boat racing, that that would be a continuation of my robotics competition that I was so passionate about, and that Carnegie Mellon has such a great mix of talented students in all fields, which I wanted because of my connection to the arts as a musician.<br/>\n<br/>\nInterview: Interview went very well (I think), interviewer said that I was the only one to bring him anything to show (videos of my team's robot in action). I mentioned how I always tried to pick the brains of engineers that I met, and discussed what I wanted out of college and my years afterward. I asked a lot of questions about campus life and opportunities. I also visited an information session, and mentioned to the interviewer that I was going to visit campus (though over winter break, when it was closed, so this could not be formally recorded...).<br/>\n<br/>\nOnly problem I see is maybe doing too little my freshman year, and selling myself short. I said I did robotics 17hrs/wk 42wks/yr over the four years, though it's more like 35hrs/wk plus day-long tournaments a lot of the time, so while I may have sold myself a little short, it's also previous years bringing down the average. Probably should have said 20, but it's really hard to estimate these things and I did not want to risk exaggerating. That may have been a mistake that cost me, along with not working with teachers on the rec letters.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm not going to go forward with the waitlist, CMU would probably be too expensive for me anyway and I'm not going to be led on. Kind of surprised to not be accepted, though, but if no one else sees any weaknesses I will have to assume it is what I have identified (though I do not see how those would drag me down that badly). It will all turn out okay. <img alt=\":)\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" title=\":)\"/> </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/21402589/#Comment_21402589\" name=\"Item_1\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2018-04-01T18:44:14+00:00\" title=\"April  1, 2018  2:44PM\">April 2018</time></a></span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">0</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2069507%2Fcarnegie-mellon-regular-decision-results-class-of-2022%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=21402589\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

Were they CS and ECE? Those two are in the single digits of % accepted. At that point (only taking 1 out of more than 10 applicants) it really comes down to very marginal things. The quantitative stuff (test cores, gpa) for the bulk of the non-accepted applicants will be as good or nearly as good as yours and that only makes up part of the evaluation. They also tend to look at ranges on the academic stuff (30-40 point differences on the SAT may not matter much so everyone above 1560 or so looks more or less equal to them on that metric). One thing I think most adcoms look for is a little bit of uniqueness/difference. If they have 9 applicants that all look more or less the same and one that has some difference, they are likely to give a lot of weight to that difference. I think you also needed to have made a strong case for CMU in your essay. If you cookie cuttered the question at all, the adcoms likely picked someone that looks similar to you but had a stronger or more unique answer to why-CMU. </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/21405203/#Comment_21405203\" name=\"Item_4\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2018-04-02T14:06:46+00:00\" title=\"April  2, 2018 10:06AM\">April 2018</time></a></span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">0</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2069507%2Fcarnegie-mellon-regular-decision-results-class-of-2022%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=21405203\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

Recommendations:<br/>\nenglish teacher, another teacher, i didn't see them and i cyberschool so there aren't strong teacher/student relationships so probably lukewarm<br/>\n<br/>\nCounselor Rec: not strong faculty/student relationships due to nature of school so likely lukewarm at best<br/>\n<br/>\nOther<br/>\n<br/>\nApplied for Financial Aid?: Yes<br/>\nIntended Major: English<br/>\nState (if domestic applicant): PA<br/>\nSchool Type: public cyber/charter<br/>\nEthnicity: Caucasian<br/>\nGender: Female<br/>\nIncome Bracket: ~50k<br/>\nHooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): first generation on a technicality (1 parent associates degree, other parent went but never finished), relatively low income (fafsa efc 3k), female<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nWhy you think you were accepted/not accepted and general comments: this was my reach school so i never expected anything but a denial, im wondering if i would have shown more interest and interviewed/toured if it would have pushed me over the edge but nonetheless im delighted. </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\"

There are a bunch of schools that compare to these programs, but Computer Science related majors are more widely known amongst industry. In fact, many CMU graduates occupy Silicon Valley and are part of top engineering and technology companies around the globe. We have famous artists and successful businessmen come out representing the school. Basically, Carnegie Mellon name is as well known as Ivys, Stanford, Caltech, MIT in the career world. (So just because your high school friends never heard of it, does not mean your dream employers wouldn't.)<br/>\n<div class=\"bbcode_left\">\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i>Are there girls at CMU? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<b>Yes</b>.<br/>\nYes, there are plenty of opportunities to meet and interact with girls, on a daily basis, regardless of your major.<br/>\nNo, they are not socially awkward.<br/>\nYes, they are ALL smart.<br/>\nIf you're looking to be surrounded by gorgeous models, you're looking in the wrong school. But if you want to be shallow about it, there are plenty of pretty girls/attractive guys around, you just have to look/try.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> What is the social scene like? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n1. Dating: Yes, people, including those of different sexual orientations, date. <i>Do you have time for a relationship?</i> Depends on where your priorities are and how good you are at managing your time. It is in no way looked down upon and always worth it. Unlike what some may think, CS and engineering majors do date, be it within the major or outside, either one is likely.<br/>\n2. Partying: There are parties every weekend if you know where to look. The parties themselves aren't \"state college\" crazy and some are even labeled as dancing parties, or sit down social parties. Possibly, people hook up. If you would like to get wasted you can probably find a way, and most likely you won't be alone. However, that does NOT make the campus community dangerous in any way and there is no peer pressure whatsoever to participate in various illegal activities. (&lt;- what I love/respect the CMU community for the most)<br/>\n3. Other: If you're not into that, there are a TON of options such as hanging around with friends, going to CMU sponsored events (concerts, shows, $1 movie nights, outdoor activities, etc)<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> What is food like? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nContrary to popular belief, there is no single cafeteria/dining hall with buffet style eating.<br/>\nThe campus food is not gourmet but for the most part, it's satisfying. A meal plan is mandatory for freshman year and the suggested one usually has enough, if not more than needed. If you are tired of campus food, you have an option to get off the meal plan starting sophomore year, as do a lot of students who end up eating off campus or making their own food.<br/>\nThe campus food has plenty of cuisines and there are healthy/vegetarian/gluten free/etc options as well. If you're wondering what meal plan to choose as a freshman look <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1510549-dining-plan.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1350303-cmu-food-options-how-good.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> What is dorm life like? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nFun. Being a residential assistant (RA) is a competitive job and only the most amazing kids get them. As a result, your RAs are really helpful, entertaining and caring.<br/>\nCMU offers co-ed (from by floor to mixed floor, not by room unless you're an upperclassman), all-girls and all-guys dorming, in addition to Greek housing. There are dorms that have standard rooms and suite rooms, and apartments for upperclassmen.<br/>\n<i> Which one do I choose? </i> <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1135080-housing-pros-cons.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> This link </a> talks about the pros and cons of most on campus housing.<br/>\n<i>Can I get a single?</i> it is VERY rare to get single rooms and those are only given to special circumstances that usually involve serious medical/health issues. A note from parents doesn't cut it: there is a process you have to go through with a bunch of doctor documentations. Besides, CMU does its best to pair you up with students who are of similar life styles as you, thus it is pretty uncommon to see crazy roommate drama.<br/>\n<i> What if I get a terrible roommate/floormates and I can't concentrate on my work? </i> Honestly, people almost always work on campus libraries or buildings. With that being said, if you're still able to focus on work in your own room, all dorms have quiet hours and in general, if you ask your neighbors nicely, they will respect your study hours. Worst possible case scenario (pretty much never happens) you can ask to move out during the academic year.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> What about extra-curricular activities and sports? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nPlease understand that CMU is not a state school that has nearly 80k fans show up to football or basketball games. However, it still has competitive options and our varsity teams compete in division III. Our men's and women's soccer teams are really good and thus admission is probably very competitive. <i> How competitive / time consuming? </i> I bet there are representatives from all CMU schools and nearly all majors in varsity teams, so it is very doable but puts stress on your schedule. <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1449939-varsity-athletics.html?highlight=sports\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Here </a> is a more detailed discussion about various CMU athletics.<br/>\n<i> If I don't want varsity, what can I do? </i> The university offers club sports which are less competitive but still have frequent practices (about 2-3 times a week, depending on the sport) and compete with neighboring universities. Finally there is Intramural sports which is just friends or organizations making teams and playing within the school for fun. It is pretty unofficial and games are usually about once a week.<br/>\n<i> Extra stuff </i> There are 100s of clubs and organizations that anyone can join. For an accurate list in detail, check <a href=\"https://stugov.andrew.cmu.edu/orgtracker/organizations/search\" rel=\"nofollow\"> this out </a>. Also, there's the school traditional <a href=\"http://cmubuggy.org/reference/What_is_buggy%3F\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Buggy Racing </a> and <a href=\"http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~kiltie/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Kiltie Band </a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n[size=+1]<b><span style=\"color:green\"> Academics </span></b>[/size]\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Does Carnegie Mellon use the credits system? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nNo. We have something called units, which correspond to the average number of hours a student might spend on the course per week. That includes lectures, recitations, labs and (approximate) homework. So usually a course is 10 or 12 units. An average student takes about 48-52 units a semester = about 4-5 courses.\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> How does grading work? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nThere is still a letter based system but there are no +/-'s. Starting freshman fall semester, you will receive letter grades (unlike some colleges that do pass/fail initially) and a corresponding GPA, which is a weighted average based on the number of units a course was. So if you have an A in a 8-unit course and a C in a 12-unit course, your GPA will not be a perfect average of 4.0 and 2.0, it will be weighted more towards the 12-unit course grade.<br/>\nMost professors calculate and release mid-semester grades which DO contain +/- next to the letter grade, but these grades do not count towards your final grade. They are just there to tell you where you are approximately in the course.\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> What is the workload like? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n\"My heart is in the work\" -Andrew Carnegie.<br/>\nOur motto.<br/>\nSo yes there is a lot of work. Nevertheless, it is not so unbearable that (god forbid) students commit suicide or something. If you feel like you're too pressured in your major, there are SO many ways to work around it: asking professors/coaches/instructors for extra time, extra help; dropping classes without consequences at any point in time during the semester; seeking CMU's professional counseling. Plus, it is *completely* acceptable to switch majors, schools, or even take gap years. People switch majors or drop out of their majors often and with great ease, because no GPA, no penny is worth the demolition of your health. Here's the breakdown by school/major:<br/>\n<b> School of Computer Science </b>: The difficulty of classes is immense, and most CS classes average out to about 15 hours a week of work. You would usually take about 2-3 CS courses each semester with some general education classes. It is doable and there is a ton of help offered from the best faculty and the brightest kids.<br/>\nCS majors still participate in extra-curricular activities, hang out with friends and TA (teaching assistant) classes. However, the amount of free time you have in the end and what you spend it on is entirely up to you. People say they're always working, yet they still spend time with their friends, most of whom are probably working on the same thing. <a href=\"http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/education/bscs/currreq_12.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">A sample course requirement list. </a><br/>\n<b> Carnegie Institute of Technology</b>: Engineering is a tough field and it requires a certain type of thinking. Depending on the engineering major you will have more or less work. From what I hear and personal experiences, <a href=\"http://www.ece.cmu.edu/programs-admissions/bachelors/academic-guide/overview.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">ECE</a> is the most difficult (and selective) engineering major, followed by <a href=\"http://www.cheme.cmu.edu/current/undergrad/undergradcatalog.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">ChemE</a>/<a href=\"http://www.materials.cmu.edu/ugrad/curriculum.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MatSci</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/me/undergraduate/degree-requirements.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MechE</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ce.cmu.edu/undergraduate/cee-academics/degree-requirements.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CivE</a>. The links are to sample schedules/curriculum of each major.<br/>\n<b> Mellon College of Science</b>: Here is where I hear different stories based on majors. If it had to be rated, Math and Physics would have the highest workload, followed closely by Chemistry and then Biology\n<ul>\n<li>Math: Depending whether you're going for a general or specialized degree the workload will be lighter for the former. Basically, the required math department courses would take you the same as or less than the amount of hours (units) of those courses. (i.e. a freshman math class rated at 12 units might require only 7 hours of work a week). However, a lot of kids double major (usually CS) or have minors, so most of their other time goes towards the courses of the respective double majors/minors.</li>\n<li>Physics: Very similar to math, but the courses tend to be more time consuming. Physics students tend to be in a bunch of clubs and organizations either way. Some of my acquaintances are going for computational physics and taking a lot of CS classes, so their workloads get as hard as double majoring. The Physics department courses are usually as time consuming as their ratings, but the difficulty of the material is very hard. One of the courses had an exam average of like 14/100 or something once.</li>\n<li>Chemistry: The amount of work is moderate if one looks only at chemistry classes. Typically, kids take about 50 units a semester of chemistry courses and most of them are manageable. The hardest and most time consuming class I heard was chem lab, which is mandatory for each semester, and even though it's rated at 12 units, a lot of kids spend ~18 hours on it each week. Aside from courses, what adds the most pressure is research, which is done on a side by about 95% of chemistry majors. Also, many of chem majors here are on a pre-med track, so they have to take extra courses and study for MCATS in order to prepare for med school. Even then, some people still participate in extra-curricular activities. So the workload is going to be the worst for those who are double-majoring/pre-meds, otherwise, it's hard but manageable.</li>\n<li>Biology: Depends. Some of my friends say that biology courses are rated at half the units they actually spend on them and that a lot of time and effort are being put into studying and doing homework. For others, biology comes easier (better memorization skills, a LOT of prior knowledge, better analyzation skills, etc). But for both about 50 units a semester is doable while also doing varsity sports/extra curriculars on a side.</li>\n</ul>\n<b> Tepper School of Business</b>: Comparing the workload of Tepper and the previously mentioned schools is like comparing oranges to apples. Tepper has a very unique curriculum and classes which have their own set of goals and requirements. Generally, the attitude towards the work is more relaxed with business majors, yet there are some who aim very high and are always busy either working on double majors, minors or actively looking for internships/jobs. The only business major friends I have are in fraternities, so they have time to be deeply involved in the frat and still do well in school. <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1166347-tepper-thread-ask-anything-preferably-related-p.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a> is an interesting thread for some basic Tepper Q/A.<br/>\n<b> College of Fine Arts (excluding Architecture): </b> Similar to Tepper, it's hard to compare the workloads to other schools. However, the required classes don't take a lot of your time at all, so it's totally up to the students to decide whether they spend hours upon hours practicing (if music) or working on personal projects (if art). It's very open for one to try out a bunch of stuff (courses at other schools, study abroad, greek life/organizations). My music major friend was able to switch into SCS in his sophomore year with all the music requirements already completed. So yes, it is relatively more relaxed.<br/>\n<b> Architecture</b>: on the other hand, is much more time consuming and semester schedules are not very flexible. Students receive a booklet in freshman year that pretty much plans out their schedules for the next 5 years (in case you weren't aware, architecture program is a 5 year program). In terms of arch-related work, you hear students always mention the all-nighters that they pulled and how people just live in the studio. However, that does not accurately reflect the whole population. I know archies who don't goof around and just focus on the work, manage their time and have frequent free evenings/weekends. But be prepared to work a lot.<br/>\n<b> Dietrich College (H&amp;SS)</b>: Probably the least demanding school judging by the required coursework. However, students usually still take the full ~50 units by filling their schedules with various electives from CMU's schools and maybe courses of double majors or minors. This is a nice <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/12312736-post3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">post</a> that goes into more detail about H&amp;SS life.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Do I need to know programming for SCS? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nNo. It is recommended but it's not required. I'd say about 30% of kids in each graduating class come to the school without prior knowledge of programming. (By the way, programming =/= website design, so saying that you made some basic websites is not saying that you know programming). And those who have programmed before probably struggle as much as those who haven't, because the CS courses here are based on a completely different mindset from what you might have had before. Still, if you're deciding whether you should or shouldn't learn some language before applying and you have the time, the answer is <b>you should.</b><br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Can I double major in [insert major] and [insert major] with a minor in [insert minor]? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n<b>Yes.</b><br/>\n<i>Is it really doable?</i> <b>Yes.</b><br/>\n<i>Really?</i> <b>Yes.</b><br/>\nNobody at CMU will ever say no to you if you want to reach higher. Your advisors might warn you against some things because of the increase in workload, but they will never stop you. So any combination of majors and minors that CMU offers is available for you. However, some departments have restrictions on double majors and minors (aka some don't offer them , GPA restrictions, unit restrictions) so you have to consult the actual department for specifics.<br/>\nI'll be honest though: be careful about what responsibilities you put on yourself. If your dream job is in software engineering but you also love biology, taking just certain courses in software engineering as a biology major (or vise versa) might suffice rather than double majoring in CS + biology and taking a whole bunch of other unnecessary courses. In addition, some majors will have pretty much no overlap (overlap: a course that fulfills a requirement in both tracks, aka killing two birds with one stone) in courses and it will require you to either come in with a bunch of AP/college credit, overload (overload: taking more units/courses than maximum suggested by your primary department, usually &gt;54) every semester, and/or spend extra money on summer semesters.<br/>\nIf you're worried about not getting a job in the industry because you don't have 3 majors and 5 minors, you're <b>wrong</b>. A lot of companies don't care what your diploma says and they care about what you actually know (crazy, isn't it?). So if you're a bio major who's applying for a programming job, you are more likely to get the job if you put on your resume all the programming courses you've taken/projects you might have done and answer technical questions correctly, rather than have a double major standing and not know what you're doing during the interviews.<br/>\nFor your convenience, I also included the double major requirements for each department:<br/>\n<b> SCS:</b> <a href=\"http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/education/bscs/second.html#major\" rel=\"nofollow\">CS</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/applying-undergraduate-major\" rel=\"nofollow\">HCI</a>, <a href=\"http://major.ri.cmu.edu/?q=node/8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robotics</a><br/>\n<b> CIT:</b> I'm not a 100% sure on this, but I believe you can only double major within CIT, and for minors there are certain ones that are offered for non-engineering students. Refer to <a href=\"http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/carnegieinstituteoftechnology/#additionalmajorsanddualdegreesincit\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> description. So engineering cannot be declared as a secondary major if your primary major is not in CIT. If you want to double major in engineering and something else, engineering must be your primary department.

I just know that Information Systems is not offered as neither double major nor a minor.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Are there courses offered during breaks? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nCMU does not have courses over winter break, but it has 2 summer sessions. Be aware that summer courses aren't cheap and I don't think it's as popular to take summer classes here as in other schools. I believe tuition is $300/unit (so if you take a regular core curriculum course, which is usually 12 units, you pay nearly 4 grand. That's not including cost of living and food). That's why I'm saying be very careful about how you plan out your double majors, minors and courseworks: summer classes might not always be the best option to catch up.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Will I interact with kids outside my major/school? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nYes. It's always up to you. The reason I'm able to answer questions about other schools so in depth is that my friend group of nearly 12 kids pretty much has no two people with the same major. The best way to meet people outside your major are in your dorm (my friend group was my dorm room floor), general education classes (electives), organizations, sports and clubs. There's actually a lot of interactions between schools and quite a lot of students tend to have two friend groups: friends outside their schools to hang out with and friends within their majors to do homework with.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> How easy is it to transfer between schools? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nIt depends on the school but it's usually doable. For instance, nobody will stop you from switching but if you don't meet the new school's requirements, it gets very hard to impossible to transfer in.<br/>\nThe hardest one is probably SCS because it's the most popular and kids usually say \"well I'm gonna go to CMU for H&amp;SS because it's really easy to get into and then when I'm here I'll switch into SCS.\" Well, the requirements for transferring include taking 2 years of CS major courses (which are still extremely difficult) while still in your primary major, getting pretty much As in all of them, AND getting special permission from the department head. So usually students just decide to stick with their primary major and apply to CS double major or just minor.<br/>\nAnother program that is very competitive is ECE. Because there is already a high demand for the major within CIT, coming in from another school is a bit harder than applying from within. Usually, the required Introduction to ECE course \"weeds out\" a good number of people (approximately 250 people enroll in the course each semester in their freshman years, and each ECE class is ~150. So 500-150 = <img alt=\":)\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" title=\":)\"/> )<br/>\nInformation System has pretty strict requirements for transferring as it is not offered as a secondary major or a minor. Even though it's part of the Deitrich College, it's a very competitive program that encompasses business, design and CS together.<br/>\nDesign is also very competitive and popular major. Transfer applications are taken very seriously and about 10-15 kids get accepted as transfers every year. Even the courses that they offer require special application (I heard students camped outside the office the night before to hand in their applications because it was first come first serve basis)<br/>\nFinally, Computational Finance is by far the hardest program to get into once you're here. They accept only 3-4 people each year, and legitimately you probably have to have a 4.0 when you apply.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther that those listed above, transferring process might include talking to a bunch of counselors and department heads, and then you're pretty much in.<br/>\nHow common is transferring? Very. Nobody is holding you in shackles so whatever you're comfortable with or interested in, it's up to you. CMU is very lenient and accepting of that kind of stuff. If you wrote a passionate essay about your love for CS and how you want to do it for the rest of your life, and once you're here you decide you despise it, nobody is going to call you up and reproach you for wanting to transfer out.<br/>\n<br/>\n[size=+1]<b><span style=\"color:green\"> Financial Aid </span></b>[/size]\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> How much does CMU cost? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nHeh. This year's estimate was ~63,500. If you don't include thousands of dollars CMU estimates on books and supplies, it's about 59,500. After freshman year you can also cut off about 5k off the estimate for rooming and meal plan if you plan on living off campus and ditching the meal plan. Still, keep in mind that this is a private and a prestigious university, so don't expect tuition to be $15k.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> I'm an international student. Do I get aid? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nUnfortunately no. Unlike other schools who get a lot of funding, CMU cannot afford to offer financial aid to international students. The US government doesn't offer its aid to international students either. The foreign students whom I talked to said that their families can either afford the full cost or they are on some prestigious scholarships that were offered by their countries. So if you want to come to CMU, start looking for scholarships right away.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> I'm a US student. Do I get aid? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nYou can. CMU is an amazing school in every aspect\u0085except its aid. You are either one of the students who gets nearly a full ride or you don't get much; there isn't really a common ground.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> What kind of aid is available to me? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n<span style=\"color:red\"><i>Grants:</i></span> CMU has an undergraduate grant that is <b>need-based</b>. Once you and your parents fill out your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) CMU does its best to meet your Estimated Family Contribution (EFC). IMPORTANT: Financial Aid is a first-come-first-serve basis. ED students get pretty much 100% of their aid met, so from then it's a race to whoever hands in their deposit/Fin Aid application the fastest for RD students. I.e. I was torn between CMU (RD) and another university, so I handed in my deposit in late April, and now my family has to pay twice our EFC.<br/>\nAside from university grant, you might be eligible to apply for federal grants, but usually those require you to be in serious financial need and they top at around $5.5k.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:red\"><i>Scholarships:</i></span>: Unfortunately, CMU does not offer URM, sports, robotics, business, math, etc. scholarships. The only merit based one available through the university is the Carnegie Scholarship, which is ONLY offered to incoming freshmen. Trust me, I've learned that the hard way. Basically, you don't explicitly apply to it when you apply to the school so you are automatically considered for it if you submit your FAFSA. It's given out to students who have excelled academically in high school and who can't get a lot of need-based aid. No you can't promise them to get a 4.0 in your freshman semesters, join 20 clubs and become the president of your class if they promise to consider you for the scholarship after you came to CMU. Either you get it when you apply or you never do.<br/>\n<i>*** This is why I <b>highly</b> encourage you to look for outside scholarships and grants way in advance. ***</i><br/>\n<span style=\"color:red\"><i>Loans:</i></span> are offered to students at any point in time during the school year through the university but they are usually there to help kids who are in need of quick money for personal expenses/emergency situations. I.e. you need to buy a $150 textbook for a class but do not have the money, you may borrow from the university.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> What factors affect my financial aid package? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nYour financial package is not final. In other words, it will most likely change on a yearly basis. You must re-apply for the aid every year and depending on the new FAFSA information your package will be adjusted.\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:red\">Change in income</span>: if your family shows a decrease in income, your financial aid package is going to increase, and vise versa.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color:red\">Siblings in school</span>: to whomever this might apply, your aid will be affected if any of your siblings are attending college ONLY. It is not affected if your siblings are attending private elementary/middle/high schools for which your parents are paying tuition.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color:red\">Outside scholarships/aid</span>: if you receive any outside scholarships, the amount of your scholarship is deducted from your financial aid package. This means that you cannot have extra money in addition to the total amount of grant money you received from CMU.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color:red\">Full-time status</span>: you must maintain a full-time student status (take over 36 units a semester) in order to keep your CMU grant or scholarship.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color:red\"> GPA</span>: I'm pretty sure you must maintain above a 2.0 GPA in order to keep your CMU scholarship but I'm not 100% sure whether that applies to the CMU grant. My best guess that it does, so it's always safe to attempt to do well in school <img alt=\":)\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" title=\":)\"/></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:red\">Other colleges you've been accepted to</span>: if you have been offered a spot at any of CMU's <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/ira/infox/external/peer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> peer</a> institutions, and it has offered you a better aid package that you received at CMU, you may request for a \"matching\" or re-calculation of the aid. It's just another way of CMU trying to win you over, and I heard that those who have been successful at matching with another school are pretty much going to CMU for free.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color:red\"> URM</span>: This isn't very explicitly known, but when I talked to my financial aid advisor here, she explained that whenever you get accepted here, CMU comes up with a certain percentage that corresponds to how much of your need it promises to meet with its aid. For example, after submitting the FAFSA, the government estimates that your need is 30k. If you were accepted with a percentage of 70%, you are guaranteed 21k from the university. When I asked how that percent is decided, she mentioned that it depends on \"how much CMU wants you\" (not her actual words). Basically, if you are a female in engineering or CS, you are likely to have a higher percentage than a male. Or if you are a hispanic -- same scenario.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Well, thanks Selena731, now I don't want to go CMU anymore. </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nLet me put it this way: CMU is an amazing school, great community, wonderful staff, plentiful of opportunities and if finances are the only things that are stopping you, you must realize the following:<br/>\n1. Private colleges are expensive no matter where you go. The only private colleges that offer great aid are those who are funded very well, i.e. Ivys, MIT, Caltech, Stanford, so on. But they are also harder to get into. CMU's name is still up there, as mentioned in the \"How prestigious is CMU\" question earlier.<br/>\n2. Looking at CMU's extremely high after college employment rate and the starting salaries of some majors, taking out loans to invest in your education will really pay off in the end. It's also a bit of a gamble: do not rely purely on the prestige of the school's name to get a job. As in, don't expect to be a lazy student and hope that putting \"Carnegie Mellon graduate\" on your resume will automatically get you a $80k job. <a href=\"https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/7885843456/h5C78329E/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> can still happen to you no matter where you go.<br/>\nI chose this school over the Cooper Union in NYC (which used to be free tuition when I applied) and I have never regretted my decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n[size=+1]<b><span style=\"color:green\"> Admissions process </span></b>[/size]\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Does CMU require SAT scores? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nNo. You may send in ACT with Writing instead.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> I'm applying to [insert school]. What SAT IIs do I need to take? And do I reaaaaally really need them or can I be an exception? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"http://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/pages/standardized-test-requirements\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Look here</a> for per school subject tests requirements. And yes, you really really need them if they are listed on the required page. I'm not an admission officer however, so if you have some very special circumstances as to why you are not able to submit an SAT II score, contact the admission office at 412-268-2082, do NOT risk not submitting it and/or waiting until last minute to find out.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Should I take Math I or Math II? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nAlways go for Math II. Which one should you submit is a different story. I'd say that if you're applying to CS or CIT and your Math II score is below 780 for the former, and below 720 for the latter, either re-take it if you have the time, or submit Math I. (and hope that your Math I is 790-800).<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Should I submit [insert SAT/ACT/SAT II here]? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nIn the last section of this post, I included admission statistics by school. If you want to know whether you need to submit your score or not, just go to the school you're applying to, and see whether your score falls within the range. If it doesn't, do NOT submit it, and look for better options (i.e. SAT is terrible, but ACT is good=&gt;submit ACT; retake the test). If you have no better options, it's really a gamble to apply. If you're very set on applying either way, a warning: CMU puts a LOT of stress on standardized tests scores and grades, so you should really polish the rest of your application, have very impressive extra curriculars and honors, and have a moving/convincing essay.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> I just took the SAT but it will not be graded before the application deadline. Am I screwed? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nNo, you should be fine as long as you indicated the grades to be sent straight to the university when you took the test. Just submit the rest of your application on time.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> I am re-taking my test now but I will not find out the results until after the application deadline. Should I send in my score without knowing the result, or should I just stick with the old one? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nThis can be a tough decision, I understand. Here's my suggestion: I would again take your old score and compare it with the statistics at the end of this post. If you do fall within the range but are in the lowest 20% of the spectrum, I would say only send it if you consistently scored very well on (legitimately taken) practice exams. (I hope you have been doing practice exams). Otherwise, just stick with your old score.<br/>\nIf you are well up in the range, just stick with your old score (why are you even re-taking the test in the first place? A 780 vs. 800 in one test is really not that important in comparison to the rest of the application, and you will only waste time and money.)<br/>\nIf your old score not even in range, send it in no matter what.<br/>\nNow in the case that you somehow do not send it, and after the deadline you realize that you have improved <b>significantly</b>, you should contact the admission office ASAP, explain your situation and ask about sending your score in. Most likely they will accept it if it's only a few weeks late. What do I mean by significant? Well, if you took the Physics SAT 5 times and scored 750, sent that in, and all of a sudden on your 6th try you get an 800, I still do not suggest you send the 800 in. Now if you were getting below 700 and get a 80+ pt increase, you should submit it.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Does CMU superscore? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nYes.

You are an international student who has studied in a local high school, taught in the country's native language: You must take the and submit the TOEFL even if you speak English at home.<br/>\n2. You are an international student who has studied in an international high school in your country, taught in English, or in a US high school: If you believe you're really fluent in English and you have above 700 CR and Writing on the SAT, you should contact the admission office and ask to get excused from the exam.<br/>\n3. You are a US legal resident/citizen who has studied in a US school: that's unfortunate, but it has happened to me. When I was filling out either the FAFSA or some form of application, there was a question that asked what language I speak at home and I put my native language (non-English), and later I have been told I needed to take the TOEFL. I called them a bunch of times to try to get out of it with no luck. Although, granted that I did not do very well on CR, I took the TOEFL anyway and got pretty much a perfect score.<br/>\nIf you did very well on the CR, you should contact CMU and explain your situation, it might have just been a misunderstanding. Keep in mind that TOEFL is pretty expensive for an exam, so it's not a simple decision.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Do my high school freshman grades count? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nAccording to <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1459212-does-cmu-take-out-freshmen-year-grades.html?highlight=freshman+grades\" rel=\"nofollow\"> this thread</a>, they do not.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Do my high school senior grades count? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nTo some extent, yes. You have to submit your latest high school transcript depending on the date you apply (mid-semester should probably suffice). Your final year grades honestly don't matter if you're already in, unless you fail something or go from A to C/D's in most of your classes. They will matter if you're on a late waitlist. Nevertheless, it's ok to slack off a *little* towards the end, you will need some rest before you hit college bottom. <img alt=\":)\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" title=\":)\"/><br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> How easy is it to transfer? What do I need to do? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nIt's hard. All the transfer students I've met in SCS/CIT/MCS had 4.0s in their old colleges, published papers, took a year-long hike through the Amazon Forest (not kidding), etc. You don't have to build a nuclear detector or anything, but you should really have top notch grades and some impressive project to show off. Once you figured that out, refer to the <a href=\"http://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/pages/transfer-admission\" rel=\"nofollow\">transfer information page</a>.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> How important is the interview? What is the interview like? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nPersonally, I don't think it's as important as grades. However if you are within close reach of an interviewer and you are just being lazy or afraid of chatting with someone, not taking the opportunity will not help you. It's not like CMU will know, but taking a few hours of your time and showing interest does factor in to the final decision.<br/>\nIf you want more information on interviews, refer to <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1441312-how-important-cmu-alumni-interview.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> this thread</a>.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> How important is the SAT?

The rest is just bonuses to cover for low grades or to support your outstanding self.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Should I apply ED or RD? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nAsk yourself how much you love CMU. If you are not very hyped about it, or it's not really your first choice school: apply RD. Other than that, there is no harm in applying early. If you get rejected ED, you would've probably gotten rejected RD. You can also get deferred.<br/>\nIf you have some special circumstance, i.e. offered a scholarship that doesn't allow you to apply ED to any school, applying to another school that doesn't allow you to apply ED anywhere else, missing important grades, etc, then you should probably apply RD to avoid the unnecessary hassle. In any case, here are some things you should know about ED:<br/>\n1. If you just meet the requirements (ie. you're a mediocre student) then applying ED will increase your chances just by the amount of applicants considered and extra show of interest. At the same time, many bright kids will be applying ED as well, so your competition will be intense.<br/>\n2. You are given certain privilege as an ED applicant that includes full aid coverage and first pick at dorms.<br/>\n3. CMU has gotten rid of its Early Action and has only ED I.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> I have been waitlisted, what do I do? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nRelax because you still didn't get rejected. The best way to treat a waitlist is to do very well in your senior year and maybe do some projects on the side. If you do something significant and you believe it will be a big change in your application (winning USAMO or something), send the change in. Other than that, you should just hope for the best!<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> How hard is it to get off the waitlist? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/ira/CDS/pdf/cds_2012_13/c-first-time-first-year-admission.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Statistically speaking, </a> hard.

For instance you can't take a beginner calculus course at your college and expect to get credit for advanced calculus course at CMU. Most of the time the credit gets counted toward Free Electives and it's more strict when it comes to getting credit for Core Curriculum requirements. You have to contact your advisor to find out what exactly you get.

They also have all these competitions and awards I've never even heard of + made a ton of coding clubs and stuff. All really not necessary. Just be a solid student and have something unique to show. Not everyone knows they want to do CS from the start of high school and are able to tailor a resume just for it, it's actually pretty unreasonable to expect that. Also, a peer of mine from my school also applied and got accepted. He's a very strong math student, has awards from competitions, and has made some apps. It shows there's many ways to get in besides being a comp sci wizard. </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/20123498/#Comment_20123498\" name=\"Item_14\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2016-12-11T13:43:25+00:00\" title=\"December 11, 2016  9:43AM\">December 2016</time></a></span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">1</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F1943729%2Fcarnegie-mellon-class-of-2021-ed-results%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=20123498\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

Other forums prohibit constant chance me threads, and if you notice nobody on this forum will actually chance you. (Feel free to search for \"chance me\" and see how many threads are actually thoroughly answered). So it would be nice that you guys either start one single \"Chance me\" thread if you're very set on showing off your achievements and grades to others. But please do not to spam the forum with chance me threads.<br/>\nWith that said, I'll try to roughly \"chance\" everyone right now by giving you all the advice I know of. However, if you don't get in, please don't sue me; I am NOT an admission officer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:red\"><b>Steps to chance yourself </b></span><br/>\nGo through these sections, see what categories you fall into and don't forget to read the comments in each category. This an EXTREMELY rough estimation. The important part of these sections is to provide you with resources and advice for improvement.<br/>\n1. <b> Grades: </b> CMU puts most of its attention to grades, so if you don't have the right grades, sorry to break it to you, but you have very low chances of getting in.\n<ul>\n<li>SAT: Look at <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/ira/factbook/pdf/facts2013/admission-and-first-year-enrollment-pdf-for-web.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> this</a> document, and go to the last page. There you will find mean SAT scores by school for the last 5 years. Find the schools you're applying to and check if your Math and CR are above the average.<br/>\nA: <span style=\"color:brown\">If above the average, Writing is around or greater than 700.</span> You should be pretty much set.<br/>\nB: <span style=\"color:brown\">If above the average but writing is lower than, say, 650.</span> Be careful because admission to the more competitive schools probably requires you to have a rather even distribution between scores, so if you have some high sections and then one low section out of nowhere, it will get their attention. Therefore, you should either explain what happened in an \"additional comments\" section of the application if the reason is significant (a simple 'I suck at CR won't really do it..), or stick with the score and work on other parts of the application. If you have the money to spend, practice more writing and re-take the SAT, without worrying about the other sections: CMU superscores either way. Repeat the same if the \"sore thumb\" section is either Math or CR as well.<br/>\nC: <span style=\"color:brown\">If below the average by less than 20 points.</span> With the writing section scenarios as above, you should still be fine depending on the rest of your application. If the rest of the application is mediocre, I say don't worry too much about re-taking the SAT unless you only took it once, or twice with significant improvement between the two tries. If you took it many times before without major improvement, I suggest you do not re-take it and focus on the rest of your application more.<br/>\n<img alt=\"D:\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/anguished.png\" title=\"D:\"/> <span style=\"color:brown\">If below the average by more than 20 points, regardless of writing score</span> Re-take the SAT and try to improve as much as possible. Or don't have high expectations for that school.</li>\n<li>ACT: You can probably use the same rubric as the SAT section above using <a href=\"http://www.act.org/solutions/college-career-readiness/compare-act-sat/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> this</a> conversion.</li>\n<li>GPA: This is a pretty straightforward judgement. A 4.0 will not hurt you, but a 3.0 will. <a href=\"http://collegeapps.about.com/od/GPA-SAT-ACT-Graphs/ss/carnegie-mellon-admission-gpa-sat-act.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> is a graph of GPAs and SAT scores. I'd say that if your GPA is around 3.75 (UW) you're a mediocre applicant. Anything lower is hitting the cold zone and anything higher is hitting the warm zone.<br/>\nA: <span style=\"color:brown\"> 3.75&lt; </span>. You should be set, although be careful about specific classes. If you have As and one D in a subject, it will stick out, so try to explain what happened in \"additional comments section\"<br/>\nB: <span style=\"color:brown\"> 3.0 &lt; GPA &lt; 3.75</span>. You should hope that the rest of the application is amazing, especially SATs, achievements and extra-curriculars. If you have the time, cram a lot and try to get 4.0 for junior/mid-senior years, and explain to them how you did horribly before but then got a hold of yourself and improved to 4.0. Or have your recommendations include a detailed explanation about your GPA about how great a person you are regardless of it.<br/>\nC: <span style=\"color:brown\"> &lt; 3.0 </span>. I have some bad news for you\u0085</li>\n<li>APs: This is like sleep: the more good sleep you have, the better. A lot of sleep that is terrible isn't as great. *Sometimes* short, power naps are good, but if you took a crappy nap you will be extremely sleep deprived.<br/>\nThere really isn't a lot of explanation for APs, because a lot of kids usually only take APs if they know they can handle them and get 4-5s. If you had some embarrassing AP scores in some subject that is not related to the one you're applying to, you should be fine. Like GPA, having 5s will not hurt you, but 2-3s is.<br/>\nOn a side: If you're applying to CIT/SCS or whatnot, having AP Comp Sci is not necessary, but if you did take it and didn't get a 5, it can look pretty embarrassing\u0085That actually applies to any major (Applying to biology and AP Bio).</li>\n</ul>\n2. <b> Essays: </b> How to write a great essay when it seems that so many topics repeat? Well, that means that you're not making it personal enough. By personal I don't mean \"Dear Diary..\" kind, but what came just from your head. Here are my suggestions for college essay writing:\n<ul>\n<li>Common Application: Spend most of your time just thinking about this. The best to do that is to ponder on questions such as \"How am I unique?\" \"What can really capture my attention and *how*?\" \"What can move me emotionally and *how* does it do so?\" \"How can I be changed? Can I be changed at all?\" I understand that these questions are generic, but you want to stand out amongst thousands. If you want to how well you picked a topic, ask yourself if someone that you know can write the same thing. I.e. \"My grandma has been a significant model in my life\" type of essay.<br/>\nTopics to avoid: how you succeeded/failed in school; how you had some college experience before; how great [whatever major you're applying to] is; about someone who died; divorce; ANY sorts of trips/traveling; how you did some research project; any sorts of competitions, awards, etc; inspirational figures unless you can write it well and spend 95% of the essay talking about you and not the person; NEVER focus on a specific school when writing the common app essay. The main part of this essay has to be about <b> you</b>. Who you are, not what you do. If you want to talk about something you did, make sure to answer the \"so what if you did _____, who are you?\"</li>\n<li>Why CMU?: <span style=\"color:red\">Very important:</span> do NOT talk about CMU when answering this question. You should only have no more than ~2 sentences mentioning the CMU program you're applying to, and that should probably be in the conclusion when you're relating your essay topic to attending the university. If you read your supplement now and you find more than that amount of CMU sentences, take them out and fill them in with more information about yourself.<br/>\nFace it, CMU's admission officers know CMU's great. They know CS program is one of the best in the world.<br/>\n-Avoid lecturing them about specific research projects that go on here: they know that you don't wanna go to school just for that research project, you will probably even switch majors when you're here.<br/>\n-Don't talk about CMU's achievements (i.e. The researchers in Chemistry have discovered this new method that could save billion lives). So what? That's just a waste of words in your essay since that told them nothing about you, maybe that you're interested in Chemistry and you've done *some* research about the department.<br/>\n-Don't talk about specific courses you would like to take. If you're interested in some very specific department, avoid talking too much about it, but do mention your interest with a sentence.<br/>\n-Remember that a lot of kids would be writing the \"I love programming, I'm so good at programming, so I wanna continue programming in SCS because it will teach me much more that I never known before\" type of essay.<br/>\n-Most important thing: do NOT talk about how much you love Andrew Carnegie/how he's your role model unless you've known his whole background story since you were a kid, and not from a few google searches and a Wikipedia page you looked at when you started the application. Similarly, avoid talking about the Scottish culture, our mascot, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is to think of a good anecdote that focuses on a specific feature of yours. Maybe something that happened in school that's very memorable, childhood dream, a very passionate future aspiration, etc. The hardest part about this supplement is keeping it under 1 page and wording it so that it sounds like you.<br/>\nIn relation to that, another <span style=\"color:red\">big suggestion</span>: try to get as little as possible influence of peers, family and councilors on your essays. Parents, if you're reading this, understand that there exists some magic in the admission officers across all universities that detects the words of a student's mind and those of an adult's mind. Somehow, out of all the prestigious schools I applied to, the only ones I got accepted to were the ones my parents and my older siblings didn't proof read. It is understandable that you might see your children write crappy essays (I mean, look at how I write: it's terrible) and you say to them that the essay style is not formal enough for college. \"You have to sound like a mature, responsible adult,\" so they say. But when you're reading what I write here, you can probably already tell a lot about my personality, even though you have never met me.<br/>\nProspective students: it is perfectly fine to ask for grammatical proof reading, but be very careful about changing words around and fixing the structure of your sentences. Your proof reader might say that instead of writing the word \"criticize\", you should write \"admonish\" or something. Apparently, that will show you have a sophisticated vocabulary of a college student, instead of a high schooler. But a few words here, a few words there, change up two sentences into one two-clause sentence, and it already doesn't sound like your original thoughts. By the way, that would also look terrible if they look at your SAT CR score or read your SAT Writing essay and see that the styles don't match up.<br/>\nTL;DR. The content is not the only thing that tells the admission officers who you are: the way you present your ideas adds a lot more meaning to how they picture you as.</li>\n</ul>\n3. <b> Recommendation: </b> A lot of students can't look at their recommendations and/or have any influence on the content. There's no hurt in asking, though\u0085 <img alt=\":)\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" title=\":)\"/> If you can look at it, make sure that whatever they write and whatever you wrote in your essays is not the same. Your recommendation should probably go into detail about some great achievements/ECs that you put on your application (this is where your research projects, awards, competitions should be described, not in your essays). Saying that you're a wonderful student and a hard worker is kind of generic, so if you can, ask your teacher or whomever to talk about *how* you're wonderful. A good person to ask for a recommendation is the one who knows you well enough to be that open with you about your recommendation letters, in my opinion. Another suggestion would be a research professor, but be careful with those because working on his project for a summer but seeing him only once during the 3 months isn't good enough for a great recommendation. If the professor doesn't decline, he/she would most likely write something cliche.<br/>\n4. <b> Extra Curriculars: </b> If you have a lot of them, single out the best ones. Honestly, \"president of tennis club\", \"founder of school's music club\", \"first chair violin\", \"[some sport] team captain\" are pretty generic. If you have nothing else, it will be pretty hard to stand out. Saying you did some club/school activity for 4 years is also not that great. I.e. you were on school's AMC team for 4 years. Well, did you win anything?<br/>\nMy best suggestion to stand out in this section is to do a lot more personal projects and research on the side. And not really something that lasted for a couple of weeks: try something more long term. If you wrote simple python programs, did some cool stuff in Java, etc, create a portfolio and link to it. Maybe you did robotics and/or built cranes or something: record yourself demonstrating your creation and make a YouTube channel.<br/>\nDoing research with a real college professor is impressive, especially if you went to a conference or entered a research competition with it. I also suggest that any college courses you've taken as a HS student should only be reported if you can provide proof (I believe colleges usually ask to send in additional transcripts if applicable) and if you did very well.<br/>\nBasically, the more non-school related stuff you have, no matter how great the club or how many HS leadership positions you had, the better.<br/>\n5. <b> Interest: </b> CMU is one of the schools who values interest in the university. However, that does not automatically guarantee you an acceptance. Nor does the lack of interest guarantee you a rejection. You probably see this around forums, but ways to show interest:\n<ul>\n<li>Campus visit</li>\n<li>Interview</li>\n<li>Pre-college</li>\n<li>Sleeping bag weekends</li>\n</ul>\nWays NOT to show interest:\n<ul>\n<li>Sending gifts/kilts/etc</li>\n<li>Talking about Andrew Carnegie in your essays</li>\n<li>Calling the office up a lot</li>\n</ul>\n6. <b> Further comparisons: </b> I understand that college process can be very nerve-wracking and you might want to know whether you will make it, where you stand in the applicant pool, etc. I made myself feel better (and worse) by just surfing past Acceptance Threads and looking at the posts and the statistics of people who made it or didn't. So for one final recommendation, refer to this list of past result threads:<br/>\n<a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-2017/1431553-official-carnegie-mellon-2017-results-thread.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 2017</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1305040-official-carnegie-mellon-university-2016-rd-results.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 2016</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1054279-official-class-2015-cmu-decisions-thread.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 2015</a><br/>\n<a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/888134-official-carnegie-mellon-university-decision-class-2014-a.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> 2014</a><br/>\nFeel free to search this forum for \"chance me\", there will be a ton of results\u0085<br/>\n<br/>\n[size=+1]<b><span style=\"color:green\"> Additional Resources </span></b>[/size]\n<ul>\n<li>Very useful data sheet about CMU that includes statistics about admission, financial aid, enrollment etc: <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/ira/CDS/cds_1213.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Common Data Set 2012-2013-Institutional Research and Analysis - Carnegie Mellon University</a></li>\n<li>Admission FAQ: <a href=\"http://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/pages/frequently-asked-questions\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carnegie Mellon Admission |</a></li>\n<li>CIT FAQ: <a href=\"http://www.cit.cmu.edu/current_students/undergraduates/faq.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Undergraduate FAQ</a></li>\n<li>SCS List of majors: <a href=\"http://www.cs.cmu.edu/overview-programs\" rel=\"nofollow\">Overview of Programs | Carnegie Mellon School of Computer Science</a></li>\n<li>Financial Aid Guide: <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/docs/finaid-guide.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/docs/finaid-guide.pdf</a></li>\n<li>Financial Aid FAQ: <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/finaid/employment/faqs.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Frequently Asked Questions-Student Financial Aid - Carnegie Mellon University</a></li>\n<li>Statistics of where students end up after graduation by college, salaries, internships, etc: <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/career/salaries-and-destinations/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Salaries &amp; Destinations-Career and Professional Development Center - Carnegie Mellon University</a> .</li>\n<li>Greek Life organizations: <a href=\"http://www.studentaffairs.cmu.edu/student-life/greek/fs/index.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Fraternities &amp; Sororities-Fraternity and Sorority Life - Carnegie Mellon University</a></li>\n<li>CMU Varsity Sports: <a href=\"http://athletics.cmu.edu/sports/fball/index\" rel=\"nofollow\">Carnegie Mellon Football - Carnegie Mellon University Athletics</a></li>\n<li>CMU Club Sports: <a href=\"http://athletics.cmu.edu/recreation/clubsports\" rel=\"nofollow\">Club Sports - Carnegie Mellon University Athletics</a></li>\n</ul>\n</div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/16609136/#Comment_16609136\" name=\"Item_1\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2013-11-22T19:55:34+00:00\" title=\"November 22, 2013  3:55PM\">November 2013</time></a></span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">14</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F1581081%2Fbefore-you-post-cmu-faq%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=16609136\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

She liked that I contributed to the<br/>\ndiscussion and stuff I think but obviously I couldn't read it so I don't know how good it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeacher Rec #2: 9/10 AP Chem teacher junior year (my intended major is Chem). Loves me but<br/>\ndoesn't know me reaaallly well on a personal level. I've heard that he uses my work as answer<br/>\nkeys in class and he's said that he's had one other student of my caliber, and that student went<br/>\nto MIT (I got rejected though lololololol). Also loves me for the ACS Olympiad stuff we did last<br/>\nyear. Plus overall he's a teddy bear to everyone, but again I don't actually know what he put.<br/>\n<br/>\nCounselor Rec: 6-7/10? I don't know my counselor very well, but she seems to really like me. On<br/>\nthe one hand, she's realllly old and kinda crazy, but on the other hand she's been doing this<br/>\ncollege stuff for so long that she seems to know her stuff.

We don't live in a gated community or anything but it's high<br/>\nHooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): none. WV and female in STEM might be bonuses though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Reflection:</b><br/>\nStrengths: GPA, test scores, leadership/community service/ECs?<br/>\nWeaknesses: no big draws, no big awards, non-stellar essays, ECs, and recs....basically everything<br/>\nelse?<br/>\nWhy you think you were accepted: above strengths<br/>\nWhere else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: so far Accepted WVU Honors, Ohio State, Case Western Reserve U, Northwestern; Rejected MIT, UChicago; Waiting on Princeton<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Other Factors:</b> ??

I PAID 8000$ for one and nothing improved, but when i studied by myself i went from a 27 to a 33 on the ACT like WTFFF. Really, don't go to hagwons they just want ur money and also they make bad study habits. Wasted weeks in there for nothing gdsjgjsdbhjfdigojeoijgngjsdkjkgnsjf. Anyway, once again be urself sorry i said that like a bunch of times i sound so monotonous but i am so oh wells and love what you love to do. Also, have fun with friends and hang out with people every once in awhile don't burn urself out in high school bc that happened to me a lot of times :P.

I sure wish I had.<br/>\nAnyway, here are my reasons to not attend Carnegie Mellon, based off my recently completed undergrad education.<br/>\n<br/>\nFirst, a short bio that might help with perspective. I majored in a STEM subject and also completed the pre-med track.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe people. CMU is a magnet for nerdy/weird people, not much of a surprise there. But what I didn't expect is that some of these people are so antisocial and awkward that it's hard to be friends with them. Many people come off as unfriendly and aloof. It's a common experience to meet someone and have them not acknowledge you when you walk past them later, which is much different than I've experienced anywhere else. Social life for many people is nonexistent. And I hate to bring it up, but the ugliness is real. You don't want to be spending the prime of your life surrounded by people who look like zombies from the walking dead. I didn't think I cared about this at first, but it's human nature.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe environment. CMU is located in Pittsburgh, which has the cloudiest weather outside Seattle in the US. In college, you spend a lot of time outside/walking, which amplifies this factor. Pittsburgh itself is a rusting old city, and while some parts of it may be nice, CMU's campus and surroundings definitely aren't uplifting.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe workload. Its every bit as horrible as you'd expect. Even if you can spare one weekend evening not studying, chances are your friends will be busy cramming for the next midterm. Midterms are not actually once a semester. They're every few weeks. I had a semester with a major exam every week. Sometimes you neglect studying for one thing to study for something else. And in the end, it's not really worth it because you won't ever use what you learned. For me, applying to med school straight out of college was not an option, since CMU killed my GPA. I was so busy studying during the school year, I had to spend my entire summer studying for the MCAT. Also, I will have to take out loans to pay for med school because my college fund was squandered on this place. Maybe, possibly, if you are in CS or ECE, the name of the school may be enough motivation to take the plunge, but anything else, forget about it!<br/>\n<br/>\nThe general vibe. It's toxic. People are hypercompetitive. The averages in classes are astronomically high. Everyday you look on social media and see your friends at other colleges having the time of their lives. Ultimately, your sacrifices are mostly in vain, as you may land a similar job as someone from anywhere else that worked 1/10th of what you did and probably paid a whole lot less too. Far worse is the prospect that you'll burn out and do even worse than if you hadn't gone here in the first place. Even if you think you're tough like I did, don't risk it. People graduate CMU having regressed socially, eyesight degraded, sleep deprived, and generally unhealthy. People sit and study for so long, many people walk in weird shuffles or bounces. Don't believe me? Take a tour of the campus.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, there's people who have different experiences here. From what I can tell, many of them are trying to make the best of a bad situation- the justification of effort mentality. Instead of accepting the reality that they paid hundreds of thousands of dollars and years of their life to suffer in the depressing hole of CMU, they change their idea of CMU and say, \"hey, it's not so bad! I'm having a good time here!\". I've even given in to this mindless coping mechanism when prospective students stop me on campus. Some people, of course, are super-geniuses and actually thrive in extreme conditions. But from my experience, most people at CMU are hard working, not brilliant like you would find at an ivy league or MIT. That's why they're not there, and it's also why CMU is always nobody's first choice school.<br/>\n<br/>\nPlease, don't make the same mistake as I did. If you are accepted to this school, go visit the campus. Do your research. Try asking trusted students/alums their most honest opinions.<br/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/2094227-why-not-to-go-to-cmu.html\" name=\"Item_\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2018-08-05T19:01:23+00:00\" title=\"August  5, 2018  3:01PM\">August 2018</time></a></span><span class=\"MItem\"> <span class=\"DateUpdated\" title=\"Edited August 16, 2018 5:51PM by CCadmin_Sorin.\">edited August 2018</span> </span></div><span class=\"DiscussionComments\">39 replies</span><div class=\"PostEdited\">Post edited by CCadmin_Sorin on <time datetime=\"2018-08-16T17:51:12+00:00\" title=\"August 16, 2018  1:51PM\">August 2018</time></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">16</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2094227%2Fwhy-not-to-go-to-cmu%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/discussion?id=2094227\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

There are a bunch of schools that compare to these programs, but Computer Science related majors are more widely known amongst industry. In fact, many CMU graduates occupy Silicon Valley and are part of top engineering and technology companies around the globe. We have famous artists and successful businessmen come out representing the school. Basically, Carnegie Mellon name is as well known as Ivys, Stanford, Caltech, MIT in the career world. (So just because your high school friends never heard of it, does not mean your dream employers wouldn't.)<br/>\n<div class=\"bbcode_left\">\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i>Are there girls at CMU? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n</div>\n<b>Yes</b>.<br/>\nYes, there are plenty of opportunities to meet and interact with girls, on a daily basis, regardless of your major.<br/>\nNo, they are not socially awkward.<br/>\nYes, they are ALL smart.<br/>\nIf you're looking to be surrounded by gorgeous models, you're looking in the wrong school. But if you want to be shallow about it, there are plenty of pretty girls/attractive guys around, you just have to look/try.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> What is the social scene like? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n1. Dating: Yes, people, including those of different sexual orientations, date. <i>Do you have time for a relationship?</i> Depends on where your priorities are and how good you are at managing your time. It is in no way looked down upon and always worth it. Unlike what some may think, CS and engineering majors do date, be it within the major or outside, either one is likely.<br/>\n2. Partying: There are parties every weekend if you know where to look. The parties themselves aren't \"state college\" crazy and some are even labeled as dancing parties, or sit down social parties. Possibly, people hook up. If you would like to get wasted you can probably find a way, and most likely you won't be alone. However, that does NOT make the campus community dangerous in any way and there is no peer pressure whatsoever to participate in various illegal activities. (&lt;- what I love/respect the CMU community for the most)<br/>\n3. Other: If you're not into that, there are a TON of options such as hanging around with friends, going to CMU sponsored events (concerts, shows, $1 movie nights, outdoor activities, etc)<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> What is food like? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nContrary to popular belief, there is no single cafeteria/dining hall with buffet style eating.<br/>\nThe campus food is not gourmet but for the most part, it's satisfying. A meal plan is mandatory for freshman year and the suggested one usually has enough, if not more than needed. If you are tired of campus food, you have an option to get off the meal plan starting sophomore year, as do a lot of students who end up eating off campus or making their own food.<br/>\nThe campus food has plenty of cuisines and there are healthy/vegetarian/gluten free/etc options as well. If you're wondering what meal plan to choose as a freshman look <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1510549-dining-plan.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a> and <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1350303-cmu-food-options-how-good.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> What is dorm life like? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nFun. Being a residential assistant (RA) is a competitive job and only the most amazing kids get them. As a result, your RAs are really helpful, entertaining and caring.<br/>\nCMU offers co-ed (from by floor to mixed floor, not by room unless you're an upperclassman), all-girls and all-guys dorming, in addition to Greek housing. There are dorms that have standard rooms and suite rooms, and apartments for upperclassmen.<br/>\n<i> Which one do I choose? </i> <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1135080-housing-pros-cons.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> This link </a> talks about the pros and cons of most on campus housing.<br/>\n<i>Can I get a single?</i> it is VERY rare to get single rooms and those are only given to special circumstances that usually involve serious medical/health issues. A note from parents doesn't cut it: there is a process you have to go through with a bunch of doctor documentations. Besides, CMU does its best to pair you up with students who are of similar life styles as you, thus it is pretty uncommon to see crazy roommate drama.<br/>\n<i> What if I get a terrible roommate/floormates and I can't concentrate on my work? </i> Honestly, people almost always work on campus libraries or buildings. With that being said, if you're still able to focus on work in your own room, all dorms have quiet hours and in general, if you ask your neighbors nicely, they will respect your study hours. Worst possible case scenario (pretty much never happens) you can ask to move out during the academic year.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> What about extra-curricular activities and sports? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nPlease understand that CMU is not a state school that has nearly 80k fans show up to football or basketball games. However, it still has competitive options and our varsity teams compete in division III. Our men's and women's soccer teams are really good and thus admission is probably very competitive. <i> How competitive / time consuming? </i> I bet there are representatives from all CMU schools and nearly all majors in varsity teams, so it is very doable but puts stress on your schedule. <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1449939-varsity-athletics.html?highlight=sports\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Here </a> is a more detailed discussion about various CMU athletics.<br/>\n<i> If I don't want varsity, what can I do? </i> The university offers club sports which are less competitive but still have frequent practices (about 2-3 times a week, depending on the sport) and compete with neighboring universities. Finally there is Intramural sports which is just friends or organizations making teams and playing within the school for fun. It is pretty unofficial and games are usually about once a week.<br/>\n<i> Extra stuff </i> There are 100s of clubs and organizations that anyone can join. For an accurate list in detail, check <a href=\"https://stugov.andrew.cmu.edu/orgtracker/organizations/search\" rel=\"nofollow\"> this out </a>. Also, there's the school traditional <a href=\"http://cmubuggy.org/reference/What_is_buggy%3F\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Buggy Racing </a> and <a href=\"http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~kiltie/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Kiltie Band </a>.<br/>\n<br/>\n[size=+1]<b><span style=\"color:green\"> Academics </span></b>[/size]\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Does Carnegie Mellon use the credits system? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nNo. We have something called units, which correspond to the average number of hours a student might spend on the course per week. That includes lectures, recitations, labs and (approximate) homework. So usually a course is 10 or 12 units. An average student takes about 48-52 units a semester = about 4-5 courses.\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> How does grading work? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nThere is still a letter based system but there are no +/-'s. Starting freshman fall semester, you will receive letter grades (unlike some colleges that do pass/fail initially) and a corresponding GPA, which is a weighted average based on the number of units a course was. So if you have an A in a 8-unit course and a C in a 12-unit course, your GPA will not be a perfect average of 4.0 and 2.0, it will be weighted more towards the 12-unit course grade.<br/>\nMost professors calculate and release mid-semester grades which DO contain +/- next to the letter grade, but these grades do not count towards your final grade. They are just there to tell you where you are approximately in the course.\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> What is the workload like? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n\"My heart is in the work\" -Andrew Carnegie.<br/>\nOur motto.<br/>\nSo yes there is a lot of work. Nevertheless, it is not so unbearable that (god forbid) students commit suicide or something. If you feel like you're too pressured in your major, there are SO many ways to work around it: asking professors/coaches/instructors for extra time, extra help; dropping classes without consequences at any point in time during the semester; seeking CMU's professional counseling. Plus, it is *completely* acceptable to switch majors, schools, or even take gap years. People switch majors or drop out of their majors often and with great ease, because no GPA, no penny is worth the demolition of your health. Here's the breakdown by school/major:<br/>\n<b> School of Computer Science </b>: The difficulty of classes is immense, and most CS classes average out to about 15 hours a week of work. You would usually take about 2-3 CS courses each semester with some general education classes. It is doable and there is a ton of help offered from the best faculty and the brightest kids.<br/>\nCS majors still participate in extra-curricular activities, hang out with friends and TA (teaching assistant) classes. However, the amount of free time you have in the end and what you spend it on is entirely up to you. People say they're always working, yet they still spend time with their friends, most of whom are probably working on the same thing. <a href=\"http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/education/bscs/currreq_12.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">A sample course requirement list. </a><br/>\n<b> Carnegie Institute of Technology</b>: Engineering is a tough field and it requires a certain type of thinking. Depending on the engineering major you will have more or less work. From what I hear and personal experiences, <a href=\"http://www.ece.cmu.edu/programs-admissions/bachelors/academic-guide/overview.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">ECE</a> is the most difficult (and selective) engineering major, followed by <a href=\"http://www.cheme.cmu.edu/current/undergrad/undergradcatalog.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">ChemE</a>/<a href=\"http://www.materials.cmu.edu/ugrad/curriculum.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MatSci</a>, <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/me/undergraduate/degree-requirements.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">MechE</a> and <a href=\"http://www.ce.cmu.edu/undergraduate/cee-academics/degree-requirements.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">CivE</a>. The links are to sample schedules/curriculum of each major.<br/>\n<b> Mellon College of Science</b>: Here is where I hear different stories based on majors. If it had to be rated, Math and Physics would have the highest workload, followed closely by Chemistry and then Biology\n<ul>\n<li>Math: Depending whether you're going for a general or specialized degree the workload will be lighter for the former. Basically, the required math department courses would take you the same as or less than the amount of hours (units) of those courses. (i.e. a freshman math class rated at 12 units might require only 7 hours of work a week). However, a lot of kids double major (usually CS) or have minors, so most of their other time goes towards the courses of the respective double majors/minors.</li>\n<li>Physics: Very similar to math, but the courses tend to be more time consuming. Physics students tend to be in a bunch of clubs and organizations either way. Some of my acquaintances are going for computational physics and taking a lot of CS classes, so their workloads get as hard as double majoring. The Physics department courses are usually as time consuming as their ratings, but the difficulty of the material is very hard. One of the courses had an exam average of like 14/100 or something once.</li>\n<li>Chemistry: The amount of work is moderate if one looks only at chemistry classes. Typically, kids take about 50 units a semester of chemistry courses and most of them are manageable. The hardest and most time consuming class I heard was chem lab, which is mandatory for each semester, and even though it's rated at 12 units, a lot of kids spend ~18 hours on it each week. Aside from courses, what adds the most pressure is research, which is done on a side by about 95% of chemistry majors. Also, many of chem majors here are on a pre-med track, so they have to take extra courses and study for MCATS in order to prepare for med school. Even then, some people still participate in extra-curricular activities. So the workload is going to be the worst for those who are double-majoring/pre-meds, otherwise, it's hard but manageable.</li>\n<li>Biology: Depends. Some of my friends say that biology courses are rated at half the units they actually spend on them and that a lot of time and effort are being put into studying and doing homework. For others, biology comes easier (better memorization skills, a LOT of prior knowledge, better analyzation skills, etc). But for both about 50 units a semester is doable while also doing varsity sports/extra curriculars on a side.</li>\n</ul>\n<b> Tepper School of Business</b>: Comparing the workload of Tepper and the previously mentioned schools is like comparing oranges to apples. Tepper has a very unique curriculum and classes which have their own set of goals and requirements. Generally, the attitude towards the work is more relaxed with business majors, yet there are some who aim very high and are always busy either working on double majors, minors or actively looking for internships/jobs. The only business major friends I have are in fraternities, so they have time to be deeply involved in the frat and still do well in school. <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1166347-tepper-thread-ask-anything-preferably-related-p.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">Here</a> is an interesting thread for some basic Tepper Q/A.<br/>\n<b> College of Fine Arts (excluding Architecture): </b> Similar to Tepper, it's hard to compare the workloads to other schools. However, the required classes don't take a lot of your time at all, so it's totally up to the students to decide whether they spend hours upon hours practicing (if music) or working on personal projects (if art). It's very open for one to try out a bunch of stuff (courses at other schools, study abroad, greek life/organizations). My music major friend was able to switch into SCS in his sophomore year with all the music requirements already completed. So yes, it is relatively more relaxed.<br/>\n<b> Architecture</b>: on the other hand, is much more time consuming and semester schedules are not very flexible. Students receive a booklet in freshman year that pretty much plans out their schedules for the next 5 years (in case you weren't aware, architecture program is a 5 year program). In terms of arch-related work, you hear students always mention the all-nighters that they pulled and how people just live in the studio. However, that does not accurately reflect the whole population. I know archies who don't goof around and just focus on the work, manage their time and have frequent free evenings/weekends. But be prepared to work a lot.<br/>\n<b> Dietrich College (H&amp;SS)</b>: Probably the least demanding school judging by the required coursework. However, students usually still take the full ~50 units by filling their schedules with various electives from CMU's schools and maybe courses of double majors or minors. This is a nice <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/12312736-post3.html\" rel=\"nofollow\">post</a> that goes into more detail about H&amp;SS life.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Do I need to know programming for SCS? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nNo. It is recommended but it's not required. I'd say about 30% of kids in each graduating class come to the school without prior knowledge of programming. (By the way, programming =/= website design, so saying that you made some basic websites is not saying that you know programming). And those who have programmed before probably struggle as much as those who haven't, because the CS courses here are based on a completely different mindset from what you might have had before. Still, if you're deciding whether you should or shouldn't learn some language before applying and you have the time, the answer is <b>you should.</b><br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Can I double major in [insert major] and [insert major] with a minor in [insert minor]? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n<b>Yes.</b><br/>\n<i>Is it really doable?</i> <b>Yes.</b><br/>\n<i>Really?</i> <b>Yes.</b><br/>\nNobody at CMU will ever say no to you if you want to reach higher. Your advisors might warn you against some things because of the increase in workload, but they will never stop you. So any combination of majors and minors that CMU offers is available for you. However, some departments have restrictions on double majors and minors (aka some don't offer them , GPA restrictions, unit restrictions) so you have to consult the actual department for specifics.<br/>\nI'll be honest though: be careful about what responsibilities you put on yourself. If your dream job is in software engineering but you also love biology, taking just certain courses in software engineering as a biology major (or vise versa) might suffice rather than double majoring in CS + biology and taking a whole bunch of other unnecessary courses. In addition, some majors will have pretty much no overlap (overlap: a course that fulfills a requirement in both tracks, aka killing two birds with one stone) in courses and it will require you to either come in with a bunch of AP/college credit, overload (overload: taking more units/courses than maximum suggested by your primary department, usually &gt;54) every semester, and/or spend extra money on summer semesters.<br/>\nIf you're worried about not getting a job in the industry because you don't have 3 majors and 5 minors, you're <b>wrong</b>. A lot of companies don't care what your diploma says and they care about what you actually know (crazy, isn't it?). So if you're a bio major who's applying for a programming job, you are more likely to get the job if you put on your resume all the programming courses you've taken/projects you might have done and answer technical questions correctly, rather than have a double major standing and not know what you're doing during the interviews.<br/>\nFor your convenience, I also included the double major requirements for each department:<br/>\n<b> SCS:</b> <a href=\"http://www.csd.cs.cmu.edu/education/bscs/second.html#major\" rel=\"nofollow\">CS</a>, <a href=\"http://www.hcii.cmu.edu/applying-undergraduate-major\" rel=\"nofollow\">HCI</a>, <a href=\"http://major.ri.cmu.edu/?q=node/8\" rel=\"nofollow\">Robotics</a><br/>\n<b> CIT:</b> I'm not a 100% sure on this, but I believe you can only double major within CIT, and for minors there are certain ones that are offered for non-engineering students. Refer to <a href=\"http://coursecatalog.web.cmu.edu/carnegieinstituteoftechnology/#additionalmajorsanddualdegreesincit\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a> description. So engineering cannot be declared as a secondary major if your primary major is not in CIT. If you want to double major in engineering and something else, engineering must be your primary department.

(Besides, double majoring in architecture\u0085who would do that to themselves?) I don't think Art has a double major program but it also has a <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/art/programs/minor.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> minor.</a>, <a href=\"http://music.cmu.edu/pages/double-major-information\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Music</a>, Design is a competitive program so a <a href=\"http://design.cmu.edu/node/122\" rel=\"nofollow\"> minor</a> is pretty much like a double major because it's a selective admission.<br/>\n<b>H&amp;SS</b> There are a lot of majors to be offered and majority offer <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/hss/advisory-center/declare-major/majors-minors-prgms.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> double majors</a> but you have to contact departments themselves. I just know that Information Systems is not offered as neither double major nor a minor.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Are there courses offered during breaks? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nCMU does not have courses over winter break, but it has 2 summer sessions. Be aware that summer courses aren't cheap and I don't think it's as popular to take summer classes here as in other schools. I believe tuition is $300/unit (so if you take a regular core curriculum course, which is usually 12 units, you pay nearly 4 grand. That's not including cost of living and food). That's why I'm saying be very careful about how you plan out your double majors, minors and courseworks: summer classes might not always be the best option to catch up.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Will I interact with kids outside my major/school? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nYes. It's always up to you. The reason I'm able to answer questions about other schools so in depth is that my friend group of nearly 12 kids pretty much has no two people with the same major. The best way to meet people outside your major are in your dorm (my friend group was my dorm room floor), general education classes (electives), organizations, sports and clubs. There's actually a lot of interactions between schools and quite a lot of students tend to have two friend groups: friends outside their schools to hang out with and friends within their majors to do homework with.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> How easy is it to transfer between schools? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nIt depends on the school but it's usually doable. For instance, nobody will stop you from switching but if you don't meet the new school's requirements, it gets very hard to impossible to transfer in.<br/>\nThe hardest one is probably SCS because it's the most popular and kids usually say \"well I'm gonna go to CMU for H&amp;SS because it's really easy to get into and then when I'm here I'll switch into SCS.\" Well, the requirements for transferring include taking 2 years of CS major courses (which are still extremely difficult) while still in your primary major, getting pretty much As in all of them, AND getting special permission from the department head. So usually students just decide to stick with their primary major and apply to CS double major or just minor.<br/>\nAnother program that is very competitive is ECE. Because there is already a high demand for the major within CIT, coming in from another school is a bit harder than applying from within. Usually, the required Introduction to ECE course \"weeds out\" a good number of people (approximately 250 people enroll in the course each semester in their freshman years, and each ECE class is ~150. So 500-150 = <img alt=\":)\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" title=\":)\"/> )<br/>\nInformation System has pretty strict requirements for transferring as it is not offered as a secondary major or a minor. Even though it's part of the Deitrich College, it's a very competitive program that encompasses business, design and CS together.<br/>\nDesign is also very competitive and popular major. Transfer applications are taken very seriously and about 10-15 kids get accepted as transfers every year. Even the courses that they offer require special application (I heard students camped outside the office the night before to hand in their applications because it was first come first serve basis)<br/>\nFinally, Computational Finance is by far the hardest program to get into once you're here. They accept only 3-4 people each year, and legitimately you probably have to have a 4.0 when you apply.<br/>\n<br/>\nOther that those listed above, transferring process might include talking to a bunch of counselors and department heads, and then you're pretty much in.<br/>\nHow common is transferring? Very. Nobody is holding you in shackles so whatever you're comfortable with or interested in, it's up to you. CMU is very lenient and accepting of that kind of stuff. If you wrote a passionate essay about your love for CS and how you want to do it for the rest of your life, and once you're here you decide you despise it, nobody is going to call you up and reproach you for wanting to transfer out.<br/>\n<br/>\n[size=+1]<b><span style=\"color:green\"> Financial Aid </span></b>[/size]\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> How much does CMU cost? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nHeh. This year's estimate was ~63,500. If you don't include thousands of dollars CMU estimates on books and supplies, it's about 59,500. After freshman year you can also cut off about 5k off the estimate for rooming and meal plan if you plan on living off campus and ditching the meal plan. Still, keep in mind that this is a private and a prestigious university, so don't expect tuition to be $15k.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> I'm an international student. Do I get aid? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nUnfortunately no. Unlike other schools who get a lot of funding, CMU cannot afford to offer financial aid to international students. The US government doesn't offer its aid to international students either. The foreign students whom I talked to said that their families can either afford the full cost or they are on some prestigious scholarships that were offered by their countries. So if you want to come to CMU, start looking for scholarships right away.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> I'm a US student. Do I get aid? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nYou can. CMU is an amazing school in every aspect\u0085except its aid. You are either one of the students who gets nearly a full ride or you don't get much; there isn't really a common ground.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> What kind of aid is available to me? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n<span style=\"color:red\"><i>Grants:</i></span> CMU has an undergraduate grant that is <b>need-based</b>. Once you and your parents fill out your Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) CMU does its best to meet your Estimated Family Contribution (EFC). IMPORTANT: Financial Aid is a first-come-first-serve basis. ED students get pretty much 100% of their aid met, so from then it's a race to whoever hands in their deposit/Fin Aid application the fastest for RD students. I.e. I was torn between CMU (RD) and another university, so I handed in my deposit in late April, and now my family has to pay twice our EFC.<br/>\nAside from university grant, you might be eligible to apply for federal grants, but usually those require you to be in serious financial need and they top at around $5.5k.<br/>\n<span style=\"color:red\"><i>Scholarships:</i></span>: Unfortunately, CMU does not offer URM, sports, robotics, business, math, etc. scholarships. The only merit based one available through the university is the Carnegie Scholarship, which is ONLY offered to incoming freshmen. Trust me, I've learned that the hard way. Basically, you don't explicitly apply to it when you apply to the school so you are automatically considered for it if you submit your FAFSA. It's given out to students who have excelled academically in high school and who can't get a lot of need-based aid. No you can't promise them to get a 4.0 in your freshman semesters, join 20 clubs and become the president of your class if they promise to consider you for the scholarship after you came to CMU. Either you get it when you apply or you never do.<br/>\n<i>*** This is why I <b>highly</b> encourage you to look for outside scholarships and grants way in advance. ***</i><br/>\n<span style=\"color:red\"><i>Loans:</i></span> are offered to students at any point in time during the school year through the university but they are usually there to help kids who are in need of quick money for personal expenses/emergency situations. I.e. you need to buy a $150 textbook for a class but do not have the money, you may borrow from the university.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> What factors affect my financial aid package? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nYour financial package is not final. In other words, it will most likely change on a yearly basis. You must re-apply for the aid every year and depending on the new FAFSA information your package will be adjusted.\n<ul>\n<li><span style=\"color:red\">Change in income</span>: if your family shows a decrease in income, your financial aid package is going to increase, and vise versa.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color:red\">Siblings in school</span>: to whomever this might apply, your aid will be affected if any of your siblings are attending college ONLY. It is not affected if your siblings are attending private elementary/middle/high schools for which your parents are paying tuition.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color:red\">Outside scholarships/aid</span>: if you receive any outside scholarships, the amount of your scholarship is deducted from your financial aid package. This means that you cannot have extra money in addition to the total amount of grant money you received from CMU.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color:red\">Full-time status</span>: you must maintain a full-time student status (take over 36 units a semester) in order to keep your CMU grant or scholarship.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color:red\"> GPA</span>: I'm pretty sure you must maintain above a 2.0 GPA in order to keep your CMU scholarship but I'm not 100% sure whether that applies to the CMU grant. My best guess that it does, so it's always safe to attempt to do well in school <img alt=\":)\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" title=\":)\"/></li>\n<li><span style=\"color:red\">Other colleges you've been accepted to</span>: if you have been offered a spot at any of CMU's <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/ira/infox/external/peer.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> peer</a> institutions, and it has offered you a better aid package that you received at CMU, you may request for a \"matching\" or re-calculation of the aid. It's just another way of CMU trying to win you over, and I heard that those who have been successful at matching with another school are pretty much going to CMU for free.</li>\n<li><span style=\"color:red\"> URM</span>: This isn't very explicitly known, but when I talked to my financial aid advisor here, she explained that whenever you get accepted here, CMU comes up with a certain percentage that corresponds to how much of your need it promises to meet with its aid. For example, after submitting the FAFSA, the government estimates that your need is 30k. If you were accepted with a percentage of 70%, you are guaranteed 21k from the university. When I asked how that percent is decided, she mentioned that it depends on \"how much CMU wants you\" (not her actual words). Basically, if you are a female in engineering or CS, you are likely to have a higher percentage than a male. Or if you are a hispanic -- same scenario.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Well, thanks Selena731, now I don't want to go CMU anymore. </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nLet me put it this way: CMU is an amazing school, great community, wonderful staff, plentiful of opportunities and if finances are the only things that are stopping you, you must realize the following:<br/>\n1. Private colleges are expensive no matter where you go. The only private colleges that offer great aid are those who are funded very well, i.e. Ivys, MIT, Caltech, Stanford, so on. But they are also harder to get into. CMU's name is still up there, as mentioned in the \"How prestigious is CMU\" question earlier.<br/>\n2. Looking at CMU's extremely high after college employment rate and the starting salaries of some majors, taking out loans to invest in your education will really pay off in the end. It's also a bit of a gamble: do not rely purely on the prestige of the school's name to get a job. As in, don't expect to be a lazy student and hope that putting \"Carnegie Mellon graduate\" on your resume will automatically get you a $80k job. <a href=\"https://i.chzbgr.com/maxW500/7885843456/h5C78329E/\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> can still happen to you no matter where you go.<br/>\nI chose this school over the Cooper Union in NYC (which used to be free tuition when I applied) and I have never regretted my decision.<br/>\n<br/>\n[size=+1]<b><span style=\"color:green\"> Admissions process </span></b>[/size]\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Does CMU require SAT scores? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nNo. You may send in ACT with Writing instead.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> I'm applying to [insert school]. What SAT IIs do I need to take? And do I reaaaaally really need them or can I be an exception? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"http://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/pages/standardized-test-requirements\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Look here</a> for per school subject tests requirements. And yes, you really really need them if they are listed on the required page. I'm not an admission officer however, so if you have some very special circumstances as to why you are not able to submit an SAT II score, contact the admission office at 412-268-2082, do NOT risk not submitting it and/or waiting until last minute to find out.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Should I take Math I or Math II? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nAlways go for Math II. Which one should you submit is a different story. I'd say that if you're applying to CS or CIT and your Math II score is below 780 for the former, and below 720 for the latter, either re-take it if you have the time, or submit Math I. (and hope that your Math I is 790-800).<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Should I submit [insert SAT/ACT/SAT II here]? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nIn the last section of this post, I included admission statistics by school. If you want to know whether you need to submit your score or not, just go to the school you're applying to, and see whether your score falls within the range. If it doesn't, do NOT submit it, and look for better options (i.e. SAT is terrible, but ACT is good=&gt;submit ACT; retake the test). If you have no better options, it's really a gamble to apply. If you're very set on applying either way, a warning: CMU puts a LOT of stress on standardized tests scores and grades, so you should really polish the rest of your application, have very impressive extra curriculars and honors, and have a moving/convincing essay.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> I just took the SAT but it will not be graded before the application deadline. Am I screwed? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nNo, you should be fine as long as you indicated the grades to be sent straight to the university when you took the test. Just submit the rest of your application on time.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> I am re-taking my test now but I will not find out the results until after the application deadline. Should I send in my score without knowing the result, or should I just stick with the old one? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nThis can be a tough decision, I understand. Here's my suggestion: I would again take your old score and compare it with the statistics at the end of this post. If you do fall within the range but are in the lowest 20% of the spectrum, I would say only send it if you consistently scored very well on (legitimately taken) practice exams. (I hope you have been doing practice exams). Otherwise, just stick with your old score.<br/>\nIf you are well up in the range, just stick with your old score (why are you even re-taking the test in the first place? A 780 vs. 800 in one test is really not that important in comparison to the rest of the application, and you will only waste time and money.)<br/>\nIf your old score not even in range, send it in no matter what.<br/>\nNow in the case that you somehow do not send it, and after the deadline you realize that you have improved <b>significantly</b>, you should contact the admission office ASAP, explain your situation and ask about sending your score in. Most likely they will accept it if it's only a few weeks late. What do I mean by significant? Well, if you took the Physics SAT 5 times and scored 750, sent that in, and all of a sudden on your 6th try you get an 800, I still do not suggest you send the 800 in. Now if you were getting below 700 and get a 80+ pt increase, you should submit it.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Does CMU superscore? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nYes. CMU is an-score school: <a href=\"http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/sat-score-use-practices-list.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://professionals.collegeboard.com/profdownload/sat-score-use-practices-list.pdf</a> so you must submit all your scores in order to be considered for that.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> I have been told that I must submit a TOEFL score. Why? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nHere are some cases:<br/>\n1. You are an international student who has studied in a local high school, taught in the country's native language: You must take the and submit the TOEFL even if you speak English at home.<br/>\n2. You are an international student who has studied in an international high school in your country, taught in English, or in a US high school: If you believe you're really fluent in English and you have above 700 CR and Writing on the SAT, you should contact the admission office and ask to get excused from the exam.<br/>\n3. You are a US legal resident/citizen who has studied in a US school: that's unfortunate, but it has happened to me. When I was filling out either the FAFSA or some form of application, there was a question that asked what language I speak at home and I put my native language (non-English), and later I have been told I needed to take the TOEFL. I called them a bunch of times to try to get out of it with no luck. Although, granted that I did not do very well on CR, I took the TOEFL anyway and got pretty much a perfect score.<br/>\nIf you did very well on the CR, you should contact CMU and explain your situation, it might have just been a misunderstanding. Keep in mind that TOEFL is pretty expensive for an exam, so it's not a simple decision.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Do my high school freshman grades count? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nAccording to <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1459212-does-cmu-take-out-freshmen-year-grades.html?highlight=freshman+grades\" rel=\"nofollow\"> this thread</a>, they do not.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Do my high school senior grades count? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nTo some extent, yes. You have to submit your latest high school transcript depending on the date you apply (mid-semester should probably suffice). Your final year grades honestly don't matter if you're already in, unless you fail something or go from A to C/D's in most of your classes. They will matter if you're on a late waitlist. Nevertheless, it's ok to slack off a *little* towards the end, you will need some rest before you hit college bottom. <img alt=\":)\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" title=\":)\"/><br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> How easy is it to transfer? What do I need to do? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nIt's hard. All the transfer students I've met in SCS/CIT/MCS had 4.0s in their old colleges, published papers, took a year-long hike through the Amazon Forest (not kidding), etc. You don't have to build a nuclear detector or anything, but you should really have top notch grades and some impressive project to show off. Once you figured that out, refer to the <a href=\"http://admission.enrollment.cmu.edu/pages/transfer-admission\" rel=\"nofollow\">transfer information page</a>.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> How important is the interview? What is the interview like? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nPersonally, I don't think it's as important as grades. However if you are within close reach of an interviewer and you are just being lazy or afraid of chatting with someone, not taking the opportunity will not help you. It's not like CMU will know, but taking a few hours of your time and showing interest does factor in to the final decision.<br/>\nIf you want more information on interviews, refer to <a href=\"http://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1441312-how-important-cmu-alumni-interview.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> this thread</a>.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> How important is the SAT? High School GPA?

The rest is just bonuses to cover for low grades or to support your outstanding self.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Should I apply ED or RD? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nAsk yourself how much you love CMU. If you are not very hyped about it, or it's not really your first choice school: apply RD. Other than that, there is no harm in applying early. If you get rejected ED, you would've probably gotten rejected RD. You can also get deferred.<br/>\nIf you have some special circumstance, i.e. offered a scholarship that doesn't allow you to apply ED to any school, applying to another school that doesn't allow you to apply ED anywhere else, missing important grades, etc, then you should probably apply RD to avoid the unnecessary hassle. In any case, here are some things you should know about ED:<br/>\n1. If you just meet the requirements (ie. you're a mediocre student) then applying ED will increase your chances just by the amount of applicants considered and extra show of interest. At the same time, many bright kids will be applying ED as well, so your competition will be intense.<br/>\n2. You are given certain privilege as an ED applicant that includes full aid coverage and first pick at dorms.<br/>\n3. CMU has gotten rid of its Early Action and has only ED I.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> I have been waitlisted, what do I do? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nRelax because you still didn't get rejected. The best way to treat a waitlist is to do very well in your senior year and maybe do some projects on the side. If you do something significant and you believe it will be a big change in your application (winning USAMO or something), send the change in. Other than that, you should just hope for the best!<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> How hard is it to get off the waitlist? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\n<a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/ira/CDS/pdf/cds_2012_13/c-first-time-first-year-admission.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Statistically speaking, </a> hard. (Section C2.)<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> Is there a limit to how much AP Credit I can get? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nNot at all. If you're up for taking all the possible APs out there, go for it. However, CMU accepts pretty much only 5s, and for the full list/exceptions you can look <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/hub/registration/docs/ap-credit.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\">here</a>.<br/>\n<blockquote class=\"Quote UserQuote\">\n<div class=\"QuoteText\"><i> I took a class at a local college. Can I transfer the credit to CMU? </i></div>\n</blockquote>\nUsually yes. The catch is that the class has to be on the same level as the one you're getting credit for. For instance you can't take a beginner calculus course at your college and expect to get credit for advanced calculus course at CMU. Most of the time the credit gets counted toward Free Electives and it's more strict when it comes to getting credit for Core Curriculum requirements. You have to contact your advisor to find out what exactly you get. Also, if you did not take a class at any of the Pittsburgh universities, your grade from that class is not reported: you just get the credit with a \" * \".<br/>\nLook at <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/hub/registration/undergraduates/ap.html\" rel=\"nofollow\"> this</a> page. </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1581081-before-you-post-cmu-faq.html\" name=\"Item_\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2013-11-22T19:54:30+00:00\" title=\"November 22, 2013  3:54PM\">November 2013</time></a></span><span class=\"MItem\"> <span class=\"DateUpdated\" title=\"Edited January 3, 2014 2:55PM by Selena731.\">edited January 2014</span> </span></div><span class=\"DiscussionComments\">42 replies</span><div class=\"PostEdited\">Post edited by Selena731 on <time datetime=\"2014-01-03T14:55:42+00:00\" title=\"January  3, 2014 10:55AM\">January 2014</time></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">12</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F1581081%2Fbefore-you-post-cmu-faq%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/discussion?id=1581081\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Other forums prohibit constant chance me threads, and if you notice nobody on this forum will actually chance you. (Feel free to search for \"chance me\" and see how many threads are actually thoroughly answered). So it would be nice that you guys either start one single \"Chance me\" thread if you're very set on showing off your achievements and grades to others. But please do not to spam the forum with chance me threads.<br/>\nWith that said, I'll try to roughly \"chance\" everyone right now by giving you all the advice I know of. However, if you don't get in, please don't sue me; I am NOT an admission officer.<br/>\n<br/>\n<span style=\"color:red\"><b>Steps to chance yourself </b></span><br/>\nGo through these sections, see what categories you fall into and don't forget to read the comments in each category. This an EXTREMELY rough estimation. The important part of these sections is to provide you with resources and advice for improvement.<br/>\n1. <b> Grades: </b> CMU puts most of its attention to grades, so if you don't have the right grades, sorry to break it to you, but you have very low chances of getting in.\n<ul>\n<li>SAT: Look at <a href=\"http://www.cmu.edu/ira/factbook/pdf/facts2013/admission-and-first-year-enrollment-pdf-for-web.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\"> this</a> document, and go to the last page. There you will find mean SAT scores by school for the last 5 years. Find the schools you're applying to and check if your Math and CR are above the average.<br/>\nA: <span style=\"color:brown\">If above the average, Writing is around or greater than 700.</span> You should be pretty much set.<br/>\nB: <span style=\"color:brown\">If above the average but writing is lower than, say, 650.</span> Be careful because admission to the more competitive schools probably requires you to have a rather even distribution between scores, so if you have some high sections and then one low section out of nowhere, it will get their attention. Therefore, you should either explain what happened in an \"additional comments\" section of the application if the reason is significant (a simple 'I suck at CR won't really do it..), or stick with the score and work on other parts of the application. If you have the money to spend, practice more writing and re-take the SAT, without worrying about the other sections: CMU superscores either way. Repeat the same if the \"sore thumb\" section is either Math or CR as well.<br/>\nC: <span style=\"color:brown\">If below the average by less than 20 points.</span> With the writing section scenarios as above, you should still be fine depending on the rest of your application. If the rest of the application is mediocre, I say don't worry too much about re-taking the SAT unless you only took it once, or twice with significant improvement between the two tries. If you took it many times before without major improvement, I suggest you do not re-take it and focus on the rest of your application more.<br/>\n<img alt=\"D:\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/anguished.png\" title=\"D:\"/> <span style=\"color:brown\">If below the average by more than 20 points, regardless of writing score</span> Re-take the SAT and try to improve as much as possible. Or don't have high expectations for that school.</li>\n<li>ACT: You can probably use the same rubric as the SAT section above using <a href=\"http://www.act.org/solutions/college-career-readiness/compare-act-sat/\" rel=\"nofollow\"> this</a> conversion.</li>\n<li>GPA: This is a pretty straightforward judgement. A 4.0 will not hurt you, but a 3.0 will. <a href=\"http://collegeapps.about.com/od/GPA-SAT-ACT-Graphs/ss/carnegie-mellon-admission-gpa-sat-act.htm\" rel=\"nofollow\">This</a> is a graph of GPAs and SAT scores. I'd say that if your GPA is around 3.75 (UW) you're a mediocre applicant. Anything lower is hitting the cold zone and anything higher is hitting the warm zone.<br/>\nA: <span style=\"color:brown\"> 3.75&lt; </span>. You should be set, although be careful about specific classes. If you have As and one D in a subject, it will stick out, so try to explain what happened in \"additional comments section\"<br/>\nB: <span style=\"color:brown\"> 3.0 &lt; GPA &lt; 3.75</span>. You should hope that the rest of the application is amazing, especially SATs, achievements and extra-curriculars. If you have the time, cram a lot and try to get 4.0 for junior/mid-senior years, and explain to them how you did horribly before but then got a hold of yourself and improved to 4.0. Or have your recommendations include a detailed explanation about your GPA about how great a person you are regardless of it.<br/>\nC: <span style=\"color:brown\"> &lt; 3.0 </span>. I have some bad news for you\u0085</li>\n<li>APs: This is like sleep: the more good sleep you have, the better. A lot of sleep that is terrible isn't as great. *Sometimes* short, power naps are good, but if you took a crappy nap you will be extremely sleep deprived.<br/>\nThere really isn't a lot of explanation for APs, because a lot of kids usually only take APs if they know they can handle them and get 4-5s. If you had some embarrassing AP scores in some subject that is not related to the one you're applying to, you should be fine. Like GPA, having 5s will not hurt you, but 2-3s is.<br/>\nOn a side: If you're applying to CIT/SCS or whatnot, having AP Comp Sci is not necessary, but if you did take it and didn't get a 5, it can look pretty embarrassing\u0085That actually applies to any major (Applying to biology and AP Bio).</li>\n</ul>\n2. <b> Essays: </b> How to write a great essay when it seems that so many topics repeat? Well, that means that you're not making it personal enough. By personal I don't mean \"Dear Diary..\" kind, but what came just from your head. Here are my suggestions for college essay writing:\n<ul>\n<li>Common Application: Spend most of your time just thinking about this. The best to do that is to ponder on questions such as \"How am I unique?\" \"What can really capture my attention and *how*?\" \"What can move me emotionally and *how* does it do so?\" \"How can I be changed? Can I be changed at all?\" I understand that these questions are generic, but you want to stand out amongst thousands. If you want to how well you picked a topic, ask yourself if someone that you know can write the same thing. I.e. \"My grandma has been a significant model in my life\" type of essay.<br/>\nTopics to avoid: how you succeeded/failed in school; how you had some college experience before; how great [whatever major you're applying to] is; about someone who died; divorce; ANY sorts of trips/traveling; how you did some research project; any sorts of competitions, awards, etc; inspirational figures unless you can write it well and spend 95% of the essay talking about you and not the person; NEVER focus on a specific school when writing the common app essay. The main part of this essay has to be about <b> you</b>. Who you are, not what you do. If you want to talk about something you did, make sure to answer the \"so what if you did _____, who are you?\"</li>\n<li>Why CMU?: <span style=\"color:red\">Very important:</span> do NOT talk about CMU when answering this question. You should only have no more than ~2 sentences mentioning the CMU program you're applying to, and that should probably be in the conclusion when you're relating your essay topic to attending the university. If you read your supplement now and you find more than that amount of CMU sentences, take them out and fill them in with more information about yourself.<br/>\nFace it, CMU's admission officers know CMU's great. They know CS program is one of the best in the world.<br/>\n-Avoid lecturing them about specific research projects that go on here: they know that you don't wanna go to school just for that research project, you will probably even switch majors when you're here.<br/>\n-Don't talk about CMU's achievements (i.e. The researchers in Chemistry have discovered this new method that could save billion lives). So what? That's just a waste of words in your essay since that told them nothing about you, maybe that you're interested in Chemistry and you've done *some* research about the department.<br/>\n-Don't talk about specific courses you would like to take. If you're interested in some very specific department, avoid talking too much about it, but do mention your interest with a sentence.<br/>\n-Remember that a lot of kids would be writing the \"I love programming, I'm so good at programming, so I wanna continue programming in SCS because it will teach me much more that I never known before\" type of essay.<br/>\n-Most important thing: do NOT talk about how much you love Andrew Carnegie/how he's your role model unless you've known his whole background story since you were a kid, and not from a few google searches and a Wikipedia page you looked at when you started the application. Similarly, avoid talking about the Scottish culture, our mascot, etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy suggestion is to think of a good anecdote that focuses on a specific feature of yours. Maybe something that happened in school that's very memorable, childhood dream, a very passionate future aspiration, etc. The hardest part about this supplement is keeping it under 1 page and wording it so that it sounds like you.<br/>\nIn relation to that, another <span style=\"color:red\">big suggestion</span>: try to get as little as possible influence of peers, family and councilors on your essays. Parents, if you're reading this, understand that there exists some magic in the admission officers across all universities that detects the words of a student's mind and those of an adult's mind. Somehow, out of all the prestigious schools I applied to, the only ones I got accepted to were the ones my parents and my older siblings didn't proof read. It is understandable that you might see your children write crappy essays (I mean, look at how I write: it's terrible) and you say to them that the essay style is not formal enough for college. \"You have to sound like a mature, responsible adult,\" so they say. But when you're reading what I write here, you can probably already tell a lot about my personality, even though you have never met me.<br/>\nProspective students: it is perfectly fine to ask for grammatical proof reading, but be very careful about changing words around and fixing the structure of your sentences. Your proof reader might say that instead of writing the word \"criticize\", you should write \"admonish\" or something. Apparently, that will show you have a sophisticated vocabulary of a college student, instead of a high schooler. But a few words here, a few words there, change up two sentences into one two-clause sentence, and it already doesn't sound like your original thoughts. By the way, that would also look terrible if they look at your SAT CR score or read your SAT Writing essay and see that the styles don't match up.<br/>\nTL;DR. The content is not the only thing that tells the admission officers who you are: the way you present your ideas adds a lot more meaning to how they picture you as.</li>\n</ul>\n3. <b> Recommendation: </b> A lot of students can't look at their recommendations and/or have any influence on the content. There's no hurt in asking, though\u0085 <img alt=\":)\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" title=\":)\"/> If you can look at it, make sure that whatever they write and whatever you wrote in your essays is not the same. Your recommendation should probably go into detail about some great achievements/ECs that you put on your application (this is where your research projects, awards, competitions should be described, not in your essays). Saying that you're a wonderful student and a hard worker is kind of generic, so if you can, ask your teacher or whomever to talk about *how* you're wonderful. A good person to ask for a recommendation is the one who knows you well enough to be that open with you about your recommendation letters, in my opinion. Another suggestion would be a research professor, but be careful with those because working on his project for a summer but seeing him only once during the 3 months isn't good enough for a great recommendation. If the professor doesn't decline, he/she would most likely write something cliche.<br/>\n4. <b> Extra Curriculars: </b> If you have a lot of them, single out the best ones. Honestly, \"president of tennis club\", \"founder of school's music club\", \"first chair violin\", \"[some sport] team captain\" are pretty generic. If you have nothing else, it will be pretty hard to stand out. Saying you did some club/school activity for 4 years is also not that great. I.e. you were on school's AMC team for 4 years. Well, did you win anything?<br/>\nMy best suggestion to stand out in this section is to do a lot more personal projects and research on the side. And not really something that lasted for a couple of weeks: try something more long term. If you wrote simple python programs, did some cool stuff in Java, etc, create a portfolio and link to it. Maybe you did robotics and/or built cranes or something: record yourself demonstrating your creation and make a YouTube channel.<br/>\nDoing research with a real college professor is impressive, especially if you went to a conference or entered a research competition with it. I also suggest that any college courses you've taken as a HS student should only be reported if you can provide proof (I believe colleges usually ask to send in additional transcripts if applicable) and if you did very well.<br/>\nBasically, the more non-school related stuff you have, no matter how great the club or how many HS leadership positions you had, the better.<br/>\n5. <b> Interest: </b> CMU is one of the schools who values interest in the university. However, that does not automatically guarantee you an acceptance. Nor does the lack of interest guarantee you a rejection. You probably see this around forums, but ways to show interest:\n<ul>\n<li>Campus visit</li>\n<li>Interview</li>\n<li>Pre-college</li>\n<li>Sleeping bag weekends</li>\n</ul>\nWays NOT to show interest:\n<ul>\n<li>Sending gifts/kilts/etc</li>\n<li>Talking about Andrew Carnegie in your essays</li>\n<li>Calling the office up a lot</li>\n</ul>\n6. <b> Further comparisons: </b> I understand that college process can be very nerve-wracking and you might want to know whether you will make it, where you stand in the applicant pool, etc. I made myself feel better (and worse) by just surfing past Acceptance Threads and looking at the posts and the statistics of people who made it or didn't.

I would guess that at least 8 out of 10 of the total applicant pool is \"highly qualified\" where highly qualified means test scores in the top 1%, nearly 4.0 unweighted GPA, &gt;&gt;4.0 weighted, large number of AP classes, etc. etc.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo how you pick the 1 out of the 8 or so that you can accept out of the highly qualified bucket?<br/>\n<br/>\nThe testing services will tell you that a small difference in score is statistically irrelevant. Something like +/-40 SAT points or +/-1pt on ACT doesn't tell you very much when comparing student A and student B. And how do you compare the student that superscored to a small advantage after 6+ attempts vs one that took the test once or twice.<br/>\n<br/>\nGPAs vary wildly between schools, particularly weighted GPAs that are all over the map.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo you can't simply say that because student B had a 20pt lower SAT and a .03 pt lower weighted GPA than student A that student A is more qualified.<br/>\n<br/>\nA lot of the discussion seems to be premised on the assumption that more qualified students were being passed over for political correctness and less qualified students were being selected. I don't see that unqualified students are being selected. I think the adcoms have a very difficult task of picking between students with effectively equivalent quantatitive metrics.<br/>\n<br/>\nAre they passing over qualified candidates, yes, probably 7 or 8 qualified applicants for each one that got accepted. Are they deliberately taking less qualified or unqualified applicants, no.. I believe they know more about what it takes to be successful in their program since they have doing this years than most of the know-it-all parents who have at most 2 or 3 go-rounds with the process and tend to be biased heavily (iwe have the MOST competitive high school, etc).<br/>\n<br/>\nIs it unfair, sure, they are having to pick one of 8 so it going to seem unfair to 7 people. It's not a 100% based on quantitative metrics. Otherwise kids could just skip all the essays, etc and just retake the SAT over and over until they get that superscored 1580 and then be done with the whole process.<br/>\n<br/>\nEach school has to pick the class that they believe will best achieve their mission and goals. I would suggest you read the GaTech admissions director's blog. He talks a lot about how they have a mission and goals for their school/class and how they endeavor to architect an incoming class that meets their institutional goals. There were a couple of very good entries back in November on this topic.<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/21418603/#Comment_21418603\" name=\"Item_65\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2018-04-05T15:29:55+00:00\" title=\"April  5, 2018 11:29AM\">April 2018</time></a></span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">3</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2021579%2Fwomen-make-up-majority-of-carnegie-mellon-first-years%2Fp4\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=21418603\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

Wrote about my experience with JROTC and why I did not want to go into the military. I think the quality of writing was probably fine, but the topic was kind of lame.<br/>\nSupplementals were ok, but I felt somewhat pretentious/ridiculous reading and writing them.<br/>\n<br/>\nRecommendations (rating 1-10, details):<br/>\nTeacher Rec #1: 8/10 English teacher, had me for AP Literature junior year. I was one of 2-3 kids<br/>\nshe had last year that got 5s. Knows me pretty well and probably a good writer. Likes me a lot,<br/>\nalthough we might have butted heads a little bit in class. She liked that I contributed to the<br/>\ndiscussion and stuff I think but obviously I couldn't read it so I don't know how good it is.<br/>\n<br/>\nTeacher Rec #2: 9/10 AP Chem teacher junior year (my intended major is Chem). Loves me but<br/>\ndoesn't know me reaaallly well on a personal level. I've heard that he uses my work as answer<br/>\nkeys in class and he's said that he's had one other student of my caliber, and that student went<br/>\nto MIT (I got rejected though lololololol). Also loves me for the ACS Olympiad stuff we did last<br/>\nyear. Plus overall he's a teddy bear to everyone, but again I don't actually know what he put.<br/>\n<br/>\nCounselor Rec: 6-7/10? I don't know my counselor very well, but she seems to really like me. On<br/>\nthe one hand, she's realllly old and kinda crazy, but on the other hand she's been doing this<br/>\ncollege stuff for so long that she seems to know her stuff. She interviewed me for an hour or so<br/>\nto help her write the recommendation.<br/>\n<br/>\nAdditional Rec: none<br/>\n<br/>\nInterview: N/A didn't have one<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Other:</b><br/>\nApplied for Financial Aid?: No<br/>\nIntended Major: Chemistry<br/>\nState (if domestic applicant): WV<br/>\nCountry (if international applicant):<br/>\nSchool Type: best public high school in state, but that's not saying much since it's WV<br/>\nEthnicity: White<br/>\nGender: Female<br/>\nIncome Bracket: pretty up there? We don't live in a gated community or anything but it's high<br/>\nHooks (URM, first generation college, etc.): none. WV and female in STEM might be bonuses though.<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Reflection:</b><br/>\nStrengths: GPA, test scores, leadership/community service/ECs?<br/>\nWeaknesses: no big draws, no big awards, non-stellar essays, ECs, and recs....basically everything<br/>\nelse?<br/>\nWhy you think you were accepted: above strengths<br/>\nWhere else were you accepted/waitlisted/rejected: so far Accepted WVU Honors, Ohio State, Case Western Reserve U, Northwestern; Rejected MIT, UChicago; Waiting on Princeton<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Other Factors:</b> ?? This is so long, what could have not been covered?<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>General Comments:</b> I don't think I will be attending CMU, but I feel truly blessed to have been accepted.

I didn't really show anyone until after I had already submitted though.</li>\n<li>Main CMU Supplement: Wrote about research and how I want to advance education through research opportunities at Carnegie Mellon. I'd say like a 8.5/10, I personally thought it was my best supplement for any school.</li>\n<li>For the book prompt, I just wrote the books I read over the year, nothing too special.

The interviews at CMU are very casual and are more to tell you about the school rather than you to present yourself.

I honestly don't know, but I'm very happy that I was accepted.<br/>\nWhat would you have done differently?: I definitely would have gotten my essay read my a teacher or a friend that was good at writing. I was just too scared to show other people my work. I guess I don't take criticism too well.<br/>\nWhere else did you apply?: Tufts (Rejected), Cornell (Waitlisted), Boston College (Accepted), Emory (Waitlisted), Case Western (Accepted), RPI (Accepted), Binghamton (Accepted), Stony Brook (Accepted), Macaulay Honors (Rejected, but accepted to the CUNY Schools), Johns Hopkins (ED, Rejected), Northeastern (Rejected), University of Michigan (Waitlisted), University of Rochester (Accepted, Deans Scholarship), University of Southern California (Rejected), New York University (Accepted).<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>Other Factors:</b> N/A<br/>\n<br/>\n<b>General Comments &amp; Advice:</b> I'd say that you never want to regret anything, so give it 110%. Try your hardest, because later after the process you don't want to wish you had done something differently. Also, try to have a certain focus in your application. Having different interests are definitely great, but don't spread yourself too thin. </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/20527581/#Comment_20527581\" name=\"Item_35\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2017-04-06T19:59:03+00:00\" title=\"April  6, 2017  3:59PM\">April 2017</time></a></span><span class=\"MItem\"> <span class=\"DateUpdated\" title=\"Edited April 6, 2017 8:00PM by BreadCrumb.\">edited April 2017</span> </span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">0</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2Fcomment%2F20527581\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=20527581\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

My intended majors are CS and/or Mathematics (preferably as double major or major/minor combo). I know that CMU CS - is highly selective and my chances maybe low; but thinking of ED in the hope that it may provide a slight advantage. One disadvantage of applying in ED as I understood: in ED, I can apply to only one CMU school (SCS in my case) and if I get rejected, I will not be considered for any other CMU schools even in RD. If I go with RD cycle however - I can apply to 2 colleges (both SCS and Mellon school of sciences) and try my luck in my both intended majors. Am I right in my understanding. Any advice/Tips?<br/>\n<br/>\nI toured CMU and went thru their curriculum - love it; no issues with finances as well. So yes - my concern with ED is purely whether I am correctly using the ED/RD to increase my chances of admission.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy brief stats:<br/>\nSAT: 1580 (780EBRW; 800M); 800's in SAT 2's (Math1/Math2/Phy); one more sat in chem.<br/>\nGPA: 3.8UW (out of 4) and 4.8W (out of 5); top 5%; high rigor with all honors or AP's.<br/>\nAP's: 11 completed by end of junior year; 5 more in senior year. In completed AP's, mostly 5's (9) with couple 4's.<br/>\nEC's/awards: decent but nothing spectacular; leadership roles in Math/Science/Tennis teams; state level wins in math/science/tech competitions. One national level math competition placement. 2xAIME qualifier. Hackathons - 2 placements. Math/CS science fair wins at state level. Another Math/CS research with an Ivy League professor under progress - no paper yet (not sure if I can get a paper but the project can be completed by Dec). National AP scholar. 250 hrs of community service (a bit of math/cs bent in the type of service)<br/>\n<br/>\nSeeking advice on what my optimum CMU strategy should be - if I am ok with either math or cs as major with an intention of pursuing the other as a second major or a minor. Thanks a bunch. </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/2151534-cmu-whether-to-apply-in-ed-or-not-scs-science-school.html\" name=\"Item_\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2019-07-26T23:16:41+00:00\" title=\"July 26, 2019  7:16PM\">July 26</time></a></span><span class=\"MItem\"> <span class=\"DateUpdated\" title=\"Edited July 26, 2019 11:17PM by clgApp20.\">edited July 26</span> </span></div><span class=\"DiscussionComments\">2 replies</span><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">0</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2151534%2Fcmu-whether-to-apply-in-ed-or-not-scs-science-school%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/discussion?id=2151534\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

I had a solid junior year with a 3.6UW (4.2W) which allowed me to take my rigorous course schedule. This year definitely got much more competitive, obviously.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf you are submitting a project, go all in on it. There is no guarantee that if you create it in a day or two that it will get you in.<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, IF you aren't on good footing with your grades, do regular decision. I know it sounds contrarian to do so, but just do it. CMU cares a lot about GPA and it will kill you if you don't have a high GPA.<br/>\n<br/>\nLastly, Demonstrated Interest must not be a factor in this year's admission. If it was, more people would have gotten in. Yield is going to tank this year.<br/>\n<br/>\nP.S.

I, too, have a 4.0 GPA across 60 credits, did the whole honors program thing, did the best I possibly could, and still got get rejected from CMU and Cornell. The sad thing is that I took three courses AT Carnegie Mellon (got a 4.0 there, too) and had recommendations from their own professors! I'm still waiting on Vanderbilt but I bet I got rejected from there, too.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think that it definitely is very political. You have to be a veteran with a great story, a URM, or from an already great school with great high school stats to get in.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's weird because I keep reading that schools want to be \"more welcoming of low-income, community college students,\" but I actually don't see this in practice at all. If you look at Cornell, 80% of their students come from 4-year schools. Much of the remaining 20% are guaranteed transfers.<br/>\n<br/>\nI will be attending my local state school this fall on a full ride. I am disappointed, but also immensely grateful to attend any college at all. I figure -- if you have the discipline to get good grades in CC, you will do fine no matter where you go. Thus, I don't think those who didn't get our second chances are necessarily screwed; we'll just have to find other ways to success. </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/21466084/#Comment_21466084\" name=\"Item_54\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2018-04-19T20:42:13+00:00\" title=\"April 19, 2018  4:42PM\">April 2018</time></a></span><span class=\"MItem\"> <span class=\"DateUpdated\" title=\"Edited April 19, 2018 8:43PM by grahamcracker123.\">edited April 2018</span> </span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">1</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2051101%2Fcmu-2018-transfer%2Fp3\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=21466084\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

In total I am going to take 11 AP tests (likely scores listed below).<br/>\nCalc BC: 5<br/>\nPsych: 5<br/>\nAPES: 5<br/>\nPhysics C: 5 (both)<br/>\nMacro/Micro: 5 (both)<br/>\nCSP: 5<br/>\nComparative Gov: 5<br/>\nUS gov: 4<br/>\nStats: 5<br/>\nMy freshman year I took only academic classes and I'm worried that will ruin my chances. Sophomore I took all honors. This year I took almost all AP and am self studying for 2 (APES and Psych). I also took 1 college english course for CCP. If you have any other suggestions for colleges please let me know!

I looked around, but all the threads comparing these three schools seem really old so...here we go.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy intention is a major in Mathematics and a minor in Computer Science. For a while I was pretty set on a career in academia for mathematics (it's fully my intention to get a Ph.D. in mathematics), but I'd like the option to go into industry as well. All majors are pretty easily available to me at Harvey Mudd and Cornell, and for Carnegie Mellon I got into MCS, but I've talked to enough people that I don't think a minor in CS would be too much of an issue (but if you have another opinion I'd appreciate it!)<br/>\n<br/>\nAbout me: I'm a homeschooler from the Midwest. Math has been a passion my whole life, and I'm pretty far into the undergrad curriculum already (Calc BC, Multi Calc, Linear Algebra, Diff Eqs, Real Analysis, Modern Algebra done already). I also love recreational math (math camps every year). I enjoy CS, but I'm also somewhat minoring in it for job security. I'm very, very vaguely interested in astrophysics/aerospace, but I don't think it'll factor in that much. My _dream_ is to work for SpaceX (in the math/CS side, not engineering), but I'm only in high school and this will definitely change.<br/>\n<br/>\nHere are the things important to me:<br/>\n-math program (esp. pure math)<br/>\n-computer science program (one that's accessible to me even as a math major)<br/>\n-math research opportunities (my background would probably allow me to start after freshman year)<br/>\n-a variety of research interests in the math program especially<br/>\n-computer science internship opportunities<br/>\n-a non-competitive atmosphere<br/>\n-a good GPA for grad school<br/>\n-professors that are accessible to me in general for questions/etc<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nOther things to consider, but that matter less:<br/>\n-school size<br/>\n-weather (doesn't really matter at all, but HMC wins hands down here)<br/>\n-a bit of flexibility in taking non-major/minor related courses (I'd be fine with or without these)<br/>\n-prestige (this barely matters for me, but I want the school I go to to be recognized by employers on both the coasts as well as at least Chicago)<br/>\n-I don't like party/greek life, but I can probably avoid it at any of the universities<br/>\n-hopefully dorms that aren't gross xD - also I'd like to live off campus after sophomore year but I don't need to<br/>\n<br/>\nInsight into _any_ of these categories would be very helpful, or even outside of these categories. I already have preconceived notions on all of them, but I'd really like to hear a lot of perspectives people might have on these schools. Please feel free to ask/PM me if you want more on my background in alignment with any of these schools.<br/>\n<br/>\nThanks!<br/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/2075678-harvey-mudd-vs-carnegie-mellon-vs-cornell.html\" name=\"Item_\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2018-04-19T01:59:54+00:00\" title=\"April 18, 2018  9:59PM\">April 2018</time></a></span></div><span class=\"DiscussionComments\">4 replies</span><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">0</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2075678%2Fharvey-mudd-vs-carnegie-mellon-vs-cornell%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/discussion?id=2075678\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Its a FANTASTIC school. My kid started freshman year in SCS. As part of orientation he got to go to Google Pittsburgh.<br/>\n2. Its a really small campus. You can get from any place to any place in less than 10 minutes. Its like a large multi building office complex basically<br/>\n3. No rats in the dorm. My kid is in Margaret Morrison St dorms<br/>\n4. The staff, the faculty the people in general were all 10/10 during move in week<br/>\n5. SCS is the most elite program I heard<br/>\n6. My child was telling me recruiting events begin as early as Sophomore year<br/>\n7. Its incredibly safe in the neighborhood. There are between 20,000 to 25,000 kids in a 5 mile radius thanks to UPitt, Duquesne and CMU<br/>\n8. Hundreds of restaurants within walking distance of CMU campus<br/>\n9. Only 13k kids at CMU so the campus is very small, it doesnt feel like a number to my kid. Its not like he/she is part of 25,000 freshman. The freshman class size is 1500? or such<br/>\n10 world class education. All sorts of industry partnerships and endowments and funding are coming CMU's way<br/>\n11. They have one of the longest orientations of any university. Almost 10 days with various amazing activities<br/>\n12. My child gets all sorts of help with tough homework<br/>\n13. Lots of technology company fairs, freebies and trinkets <img alt=\":)\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" title=\":)\"/><br/>\n14. You MUST visit if you can. Visit, tour and interview will get u the admission if you are in the Top 5 of your graduating class with 15 APs almost all with As and a SAT/ACT of 1550-34+ <img alt=\":)\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" title=\":)\"/>)<br/>\n15. Every communication, is very crisp, straightforward and direct<br/>\n16. Never had to wait more than 4 hours during a work day to get a email response from Admissions or Financial Aid. 10/10 for that alone. Astounding!!<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nCons<br/>\n<br/>\n1. Not for everyone<br/>\n2. For every hour of instruction there is easily between 2-3 hours of homework. My kid has around 20-25 hours of classes a week, kid spends 5-7 hours a day (averaging it with weekends) doing homework (must be SCS too... who knows.)<br/>\n3. Grading is very very tough<br/>\n4. Not much time for drugs drinking or socializing (feels great as a parent <img alt=\":)\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" title=\":)\"/>)<br/>\n5. Doesnt get to go out much into Pittsburgh<br/>\n6. Not one cafeteria, CMU has like 20 or so dining options/restaurants<br/>\n7. Intense<br/>\n8 Nobody gets a 4.0. Highest GPA we were told was 3.4?<br/>\n9. Some housing, Stever, Residence on the 5th etc are almost a mile away from campus. Its great in Fall, but in winter it might get rough<br/>\n10. NCAA Division III school<br/>\n11 Rains pretty much everyday, humidity 74-80%<br/>\n12 No airconditioning in many dorms<br/>\n13. Rooms are tiny unless its Mudge House<br/>\n14. Does not have any Merit aid. Very little. Dont guarantee aid.<br/>\n15. EXPENSIVE SCHOOL Sticker price (if ur family has assets ) is over $65k a YEAR <img alt=\":(\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/frowning.png\" title=\":(\"/>(<br/>\n16 SCS acceptance rate I hear is around 5-6% of applicants. Almost like an Ivy.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/20863456/#Comment_20863456\" name=\"Item_1\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2017-09-21T02:27:02+00:00\" title=\"September 20, 2017 10:27PM\">September 2017</time></a></span><span class=\"MItem\"> <span class=\"DateUpdated\" title=\"Edited September 21, 2017 2:39AM by BoiDel.\">edited September 2017</span> </span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">1</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2018707%2Fpros-and-cons-of-carnegie-mellon%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=20863456\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

I got a 1360 (690 math and 670 reading/writing) on the SAT, and based on their statistics that is the absolute minimum my SAT can be. I have a 4.5 weighed GPA. My AP scores are<br/>\nChem: 4<br/>\nLang and Comp: 3<br/>\nPhysics 1: 2<br/>\nStatistics: 2<br/>\nI'm taking AP calculus this year, which I fully expect a 5 on, physics c, physics 2, Spanish, and literature (all AP)<br/>\nI've had straight A's all 4 years of high school, most of those were A+s.<br/>\n650 on the Chem sat 2, but I'm not too worried about this score considering I got a 4. I plan to take the Math 2 subject test soon.<br/>\nMy activities include Debate captain, Vice President and co creator of chess club, clarinet section leader in marching band, first seat clarinet and Vice President in concert band, member of jazz band which is an elite group in my school, Sunday school teacher with 100+ hours of community service within my church, member of NHS for 3 years.<br/>\nAlso if it matters in terms of admission, I'm female and my ethnicity is Cuban and Armenian. Will my sat score set me back in terms of admissions?? Should I take the sat again maybe in January and have the scores sent directly to them in hopes of a higher score? I plan to major in chemical engineering, or chemistry on a premed track. </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/2024588-chances-at-getting-into-carnegie-mellon.html\" name=\"Item_\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2017-10-15T21:35:09+00:00\" title=\"October 15, 2017  5:35PM\">October 2017</time></a></span><span class=\"MItem\"> <span class=\"DateUpdated\" title=\"Edited October 15, 2017 9:36PM by michellejosephi.\">edited October 2017</span> </span></div><span class=\"DiscussionComments\">3 replies</span><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">0</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2024588%2Fchances-at-getting-into-carnegie-mellon%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/discussion?id=2024588\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

I wanted to make this post to see if there is anything else I can learn about CMU's School of Art, specifically for Design and Art. I feel like looking online usually leads me to either general CMU discussion threads for its engineering/compsci programs, or its school website which I've already looked at way too much, probably.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf anyone can answer the following questions or even just give their take on it, it'd be much appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\n-Do they generally care more about the student's portfolio, or their stats?<br/>\n-Do they favor more pieces to have more quality technical-wise, or would they prefer to see originality/practicality/creativity?<br/>\n-How is the competitiveness of the program compared to other art schools like RISD/MICA/Parsons? The acceptance rate seems significantly lower, but so does the total applicant pool.<br/>\n<br/>\nI think I had somewhat decent pieces, but stats-wise I know the fact I'm a pretty inconsistent as a student could hurt me significantly. My super-scored SAT is 1490 (780 RW, 710 M), but there isn't an upward-going trend, and it actually dropped down to 1360 once. I wasn't feeling well at the time, and adding that on top of my already inconsistent test-taking tendencies ultimately lead to this disaster of a test.<br/>\n<br/>\nI'm also not doing great academically in the sense I'm doing really poorly in one of my core classes (like, definite outlier type of poor.) My GPA is currently a 3.72 weighted by 0.5 (taking full IB courses/diploma in a private international school). Overall, my student profile looks really bleak, but I do think I have a few positives as well; my essays, (at least, in my opinion) were well-thought out and relatively original if my counselor is to be trusted. My TOEFL scores are fine (119), and I plan on doing the IntialView interview in a few days. I'm never really one to get nervous about interviews/speaking about myself, so I'm not too worried about that going wrong, either.<br/>\n<br/>\nI also have decent letters of recommendation, in particular one from a professor I worked for outside of school. My activities aren't anything special, but the vast majority of them are creative and demonstrate leadership abilities, as well as engagement with the community around me.<br/>\n<br/>\nThe reason I'm even applying to CMU at all is because I genuinely want to experience and learn art in an environment that makes it a point to foster the connection between art and STEM. Many of the works in my portfolio demonstrate a good degree of awareness in current events, ethics, philosophy, as well as imaginative thinking. Talking about my ideas and my works have always been my strongest point. I also believe I'm fairly strong (though not God-tier) technical-wise. I attended a well known precollege program (not CMU's) in the summer of my sophomore year, and received all A's.<br/>\n<br/>\nIt's honestly pretty scary seeing other 'chance me' posts on this forum with students who have stats so much higher than I do (of course, it's also a self-selecting group), but it didn't stop me from applying, so it's not going to stop me from making this post either. If anyone has any advice, or simply want to talk about CMU school of art, please let me know!<br/>\n<br/>\nAlso, if you want to see some of the pieces in my portfolio/are willing to show me some of yours, just send me a message! <img alt=\":)\" class=\"emoji\" height=\"20\" src=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/resources/emoji/smile.png\" title=\":)\"/> </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/2122711-cmu-school-of-art-info-chance-me-general-questions.html\" name=\"Item_\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2019-01-22T13:13:45+00:00\" title=\"January 22, 2019  9:13AM\">January 22</time></a></span></div><span class=\"DiscussionComments\">5 replies</span><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">0</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2122711%2Fcmu-school-of-art-info-chance-me-general-questions%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/discussion?id=2122711\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

Just take it again and apply for the National Merit Scholarship in which will increase your chances by a ton.<br/>\n<br/>\nHonor societies: Congrats on National Honor Society! That's definitely a great start. If I were you though, I would try to apply to the Math Honor Society (if they have it at school) and Science Honor Society (again if available).<br/>\n<br/>\nClubs: Look for a robotics club. just for the extra edge.<br/>\n<br/>\nWork: Look for some internship opportunities in a computer company to show off your computer experience (Microsoft, finances)<br/>\n<br/>\nFinal: A 4.1 GPA and lots of APs are not going to get you in, look for something that makes you stand out.<br/>\n<br/>\nGood luck with your endeavors and keep up the great work! </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/20709019/#Comment_20709019\" name=\"Item_2\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2017-06-10T21:38:37+00:00\" title=\"June 10, 2017  5:38PM\">June 2017</time></a></span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">0</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F1997902%2Fchances-at-cmu%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=20709019\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

I have been an intern at a biochemistry lab at BSU since the summer after my sophomore year. I have been a coauthor on 3 published scientific posters and am writing my own this summer. Also I will be helping train another student in the lab this summer. I am also helping plan a TEDx youth event and will be a speaker at it this fall. I am a member of the National Honor Society. Lastly, I am volunteering at a Catholic charity this summer doing interviews of workers and customers, writing articles for them and redesgning their website.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy concerns is my lack of science this year. I took two last year though and have several years of high school science from years before. I had to take World History this year to make up for not doing it my sophomore year. Also I have been going to a biochem lab several times of week and reading textbooks for that this year, so I think that compensates. I know Carnegie Mellon does not imput your freshman year grades into their GPA calculation which is why I didn't add it here.<br/>\n<br/>\nMy question is if I should apply regular decision or early decision. I have calculated out through CMU's financial aid sources and the school falls into an affordable range for me and it is my number one choice. If I apply regular decision would that include my senior grades into the GPA calculation because I know ED is only sophomore and junior year. I'm nervous that my subpar GPA will hinder my chances. Also I studying really hard right now for the SAT and ACT. All the pretests I have done have me at 30-32 without any prep at all.<br/>\n<br/>\nBasically I have no idea what decision format to apply for and I have no idea how my chances are. Any help would be appreciated!<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/carnegie-mellon-university/1994480-should-i-ed-or-rd.html\" name=\"Item_\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2017-05-24T15:47:28+00:00\" title=\"May 24, 2017 11:47AM\">May 2017</time></a></span></div><span class=\"DiscussionComments\">10 replies</span><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">0</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F1994480%2Fshould-i-ed-or-rd%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/discussion?id=1994480\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>"

The regular admitaance rate is 13.7%. So clearly there is a big difference. Considering MCS is a few percentage points higher, I'm assuming theED rate would be too. I'm not sure what my chances honestly are. My UW GPA is 3.86 for my sophomore and junior year. My final standardized test scores are not in yet. I'm waiting on my ACT score to come back. My predicted score is somewhere between 30-32 so I obviously need to study this summer to compensate and should take the SAT. I also need to take the Math II subject test. My extracurricular are pretty good in my opinion. I have been working consistently in a biochemistry lab with my name published on several posters so far and I am authoring my own soon. So my chances seem decent, at least to me.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/01/13/college-admission-stats-class-of-2021/?utm_term=.4004218f51c5\" rel=\"nofollow\">https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/grade-point/wp/2017/01/13/college-admission-stats-class-of-2021/?utm_term=.4004218f51c5</a> </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/20681876/#Comment_20681876\" name=\"Item_8\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2017-05-26T06:56:33+00:00\" title=\"May 26, 2017  2:56AM\">May 2017</time></a></span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">0</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F1994480%2Fshould-i-ed-or-rd%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=20681876\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

My son is a non-scs freshman at CMU now and he is not finding it impossible to obtain a high QPA, even while taking an overload of classes.

I was quite a mediocre high school student with very high test scores. My rank was in the top 5%, but I had terrible attendance, some B's, and I never did homework. My letters of recommendation were at best ambivalent. Yes I was bored, but also quite depressed. I could have thought that by losing my chance to go to Harvard, my life was over right there. (By the way, I didn't even apply to Harvard, as I was fairly sure I wouldn't get in on GPA) . I went to University of Michigan, which was my safety. I am proud to say that I never went to a single frat party while there.<br/>\n<br/>\nBut here's what I found: wherever you go, no matter how perfect you think it will be, you are still the same person that you were when you walked in the door. I went to college, I went abroad to live in 4 different countries, etc. If I went somewhere depressed, I was still depressed in the new place. If I went in curious and enthusiastic, that is how I approached the new environment. No place, and no institution will suddenly make you whole.<br/>\n<br/>\nI found (and I think you will find) that the game is not over at 18, no matter how much you mess up. You are still writing your own future. You can be anything you want. You have already overcome significant adversity. You already have solid skills and you have developed, in the last 2 years, a reasonable work ethic. Now it is time to challenge yourself in other ways. Become a bit more adaptable. Try to figure out what you really want, rather than what will impress other people.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnother example: I went to a top graduate school in my field -- one that grooms students to enter academia. For a while I worked as a professor. I still wasn't happy, even though that had been my aspiration. Now I run my own (charity oriented) business. This occupation offers me less money and less prestige than my peers receive. But it allows me to engage my mind, set my own hours, decide my own cases, and change people's lives every day.<br/>\n<br/>\nIf life is a prestige competition, then I guess I lost. Yet doing this other job, I respect myself. I don't feel empty. I am no one's lackey, working each day to make lots of money for someone else. I am not stuck teaching a class to students who are forced to be there for a distribution requirement. I don't have to go endless repetitive department meetings.<br/>\n<br/>\nAs for prestige, the more you have, the more you need. I find I don't need it.<br/>\n<br/>\nSo think about what you really need to get out of college. Then, do your best to find that. I promise you that if you go to your state's flagship (or a comparable school), and you are at the tippy top of their computer science dept, you will have opportunities galore for further education or employment. Just please remember career isn't everything. You need friends, you need satisfying leisure activities, and you need a sense of self-efficacy and meaning in life to be content.<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, if you still want to go to CMU 4 years from now, apply for grad school.<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/21774926/#Comment_21774926\" name=\"Item_13\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2018-11-05T06:19:49+00:00\" title=\"November  5, 2018  2:19AM\">November 2018</time></a></span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">2</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2108719%2Fchance-me-for-ed-to-scs%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=21774926\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

Check out the length of the Dean's list in the various colleges to test this hypothesis. By my analysis, half of Dietrich's undergrads are on the honors + high honors list -- that means that half the undergrads have over a 3.5, and half of those have over a 3.8 My DS so far has a GPA that would be high enough to be competitive in med school (he is not interested, but his GPA would also be competitive for top law schools or grad schools, which may be a more likely aspiration.)<br/>\n<br/>\nMy son's impression is that high grades require excellent time management skills. I am certain those skills are also required at MIT, Harvard, and Penn.<br/>\n<br/>\nSure, the weather isn't great. I can say from personal experience that the weather is also pretty darn dismal at University of Michigan, and U Chicago. I had a tremendously miserable cold rainy conference at Harvard one year, where each day I walked into the auditorium covered in mud, and several other visits to Harvard that were cursed with horrible weather.

The people: First off, f*** you for judging a school based on your opinion of the student body's attractiveness and looks. Now, I will be the first to admit that CMU is NOT anything close to a party school and that most kids certainly seem to prioritize academics over social stuff. HOWEVER, pretty much every single person I've met has been very nice and pleasant. Yes, they are probably not into \"play hard\" culture that you will find in other schools, but they are all very nice people.<br/>\n<br/>\n2. Pittsburgh weather. Got me there, it sucks. Although many other great schools are in the snowy/cloudy/cold northeast.<br/>\n<br/>\n3. The workload. Yes, it is tough. Everyone will of course have different perspectives on this depending on their major/time management skills/planning etc. but in general it is true that CMU across majors is very hard. That being said, I don't think CS/Engineering/Science/Math/Econ etc. would be much easier at other universities.<br/>\n<br/>\n4. The vibe/toxicity. I actually COMPLETELY DISAGREE with your assessment. CMU is generally known as a college that is NOT toxic/cut-throat. This is because most kids know that they will land a solid job after college, and there is little incentive to be cut-throat. Everyone I know in my engineering classes is always ready to study together and collaborate etc. It is true that students probably over-obsess about academics than they need to, but certainly not a level where the students feel like they are working against each other instead of together. I'm actually very surprised you feel CMU is cutthroat, as all of my experiences have said otherwise personally. I think maybe you felt it was cutthroat as you were pre-med and so a super high GPA matters a lot to you while it doesn't for most other students. I think CMU is just a wrong school for pre-med, as getting a 4.0 GPA is not the point of a CMU education generally speaking, nor is it common, as you pretty much have to be one of those geniuses for that to happen. </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/21703099/#Comment_21703099\" name=\"Item_15\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2018-09-13T01:39:11+00:00\" title=\"September 12, 2018  9:39PM\">September 2018</time></a></span><span class=\"MItem\"> <span class=\"DateUpdated\" title=\"Edited September 13, 2018 1:41AM by JonTargareyan.\">edited September 2018</span> </span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">3</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2094227%2Fwhy-not-to-go-to-cmu%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=21703099\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

In no shape or form period. I do NOT want to major in CS at ALL, the stress that school imposes on the students is straight up abuse (+ Stockholm syndrome). And plus, I am not interested in CS at all. And please, you are a parent, you are not on campus with the view/perspective I have. And nice that your son doesn't conform to the stereotype, once again I said lots not every person. Social life is always iffy since it's dependent on the people around you so it's pretty variable each year, but in nature CS kids are usually extremely introverted. And plus, the stress culture here is not ignored but is pretty much encouraged here.<br/>\n<br/>\n\"They are taught by the best minds in CS in the world. Its not a community college or a mail order university, yes, that part I agree..... and everyone gets straight As have a GPA of 5.88 out of 4 it would be ridiculous.\" &lt;--- This feeds into the stress culture. On campus there are many discussions surrounding why the average GPA on campus is so low for having the best minds on campus (of course comparing it to our peer institutions, we are very harsh with grading). Everyone getting straight A's is not a problem, and I never understood why people see it that way, receiving low grades does not signify hard-work or \"bang for buck\". On the contrary it shows that CMU might have the bar so hard it's just impossible to even graze that bar (and that concept in itself leads to insanity). CMU is currently working to gauge how harsh professors are grading to remove this \"it's CMU of course you'll work 10 hours straight and get low grades\". On top of that CMU wants people to see their hard work paid off by receiving the grades they deserve without sacrificing their sanity.<br/>\n<br/>\nAnd of course I am angry, not at the SCS kids, but the culture the school encourages. It is not healthy and is unsustainable for students. I mean who wouldn't be angry at the fact they put in hours and get nothing in return, it is completely demoralizing. On top of that it brings down the whole mood of the campus ruining the college experience (and I mean just being content/happy). I agree CMU is not for everyone/anyone, it's working on its issues. A school can maintain both its academic prowess, prestige, and happy students CMU is trying to adjust the playing field.<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/21417767/#Comment_21417767\" name=\"Item_13\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2018-04-05T07:30:30+00:00\" title=\"April  5, 2018  3:30AM\">April 2018</time></a></span><span class=\"MItem\"> <span class=\"DateUpdated\" title=\"Edited April 5, 2018 7:34AM by CougarCatClan.\">edited April 2018</span> </span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">2</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2070247%2Fcarnegie-mellon-student-life%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=21417767\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

I'm currently a student at CMU, and I'd like to share my twopence about my experience here.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) The misconception about \"ugly people\" is really false. Sure, we don't attract models, but we clean up pretty well. I'm pretty sure any college has their share of sweatpant-wearing tired humans.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) I agree that there are a lot of people who at first seem aloof and awkward. I think even I can be aloof and awkward at times. But doesn't everyone? This isn't a defining characteristic about the school. In fact, pretty much every person I've walked up to here has been kind, friendly, and helpful. Sure, there are some people who aren't, but that's at any school. You just have to find the people that you vibe with, and I guarantee that in such a diverse environment like CMU you will.<br/>\nFriends don't come to you on a platter. Contrary to what everyone says about \"college being the best 4 years of your life,\" I'd say freshman year SUCKS. Everyone thinks they're God's Own Creation at first and it takes a while for them to realize that they need to make an effort to be social if they want that experience. Don't discount CMU just because the social experience will be hard, because trust me, even among my friends at Duke, Madison, MIT etc. it's just as hard.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) The workload is rough, not gonna lie. But it is NOT cutthroat if you don't want it to be. Sure, if you want to be friends with the top few of the class and constantly compare yourself to them you're gonna have a tough time. But realize that it is OKAY to be average at CMU because it already took a lot to get here in the first place.<br/>\nA defining characteristic of students at CMU (at least in my eyes) is that everyone is really passionate about their work. They give whatever their major is (CS, math, drama, design, whatever) literally EVERYTHING they can because they truly love it. That's not to say they don't love other things: I know students thriving who are athletes or are in Greek Life and they know how to have a good time non-academically as well. But the baseline is that they care a lot about everything they apply themselves to.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) NOT TOXIC. AT ALL. Again, like I said, if you choose to put yourself in a toxic friend group that's your problem. The nice thing about college is that you get to choose who you hang out with (unlike high school) and you can use it to your advantage. I personally love CMU because I have great, understanding, helpful friends and equivalently helpful teachers. For example, I've been sick for a while and my professors have been great about getting me the appropriate extensions so that I can manage my stress, illness, and workload appropriately. Likewise, my friends have been looking out for me healthwise and academically.<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/profile/elloraa\" rel=\"nofollow\">@elloraa</a> , I'm sorry you had a poor experience, but I don't understand how you are uniquely attributing these problems to CMU. Maybe it's the pre-med issue? I wouldn't come to CMU for that.<br/>\n<br/>\nPersonally, the supportive environment I've experienced here has been great, but I had to make a serious effort to seek out friends, get to know my professors, and use resources like academic development to succeed. Sure, my GPA isn't a 4.0, but I'm at college to learn and I know that the academic challenge here is going to be worth it for my future. </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/22128587/#Comment_22128587\" name=\"Item_25\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2019-03-28T17:12:44+00:00\" title=\"March 28, 2019  1:12PM\">March 28</time></a></span><span class=\"MItem\"> <span class=\"DateUpdated\" title=\"Edited March 28, 2019 5:15PM by Cicebro.\">edited March 28</span> </span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">6</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2094227%2Fwhy-not-to-go-to-cmu%2Fp2\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=22128587\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

Getting a 4.0 was somewhat rare, but every school had 1 or 2, sometimes 4 or 5. Almost anybody who had a 4.0 also took honors or if available AP classes -- that is just what you did back then. We had \"tracks\", and if you got all A's, well, you were moved up to the highest track. The top 5-10 students in the class occasionally went to an Ivy or an elite LAC, but more likely went to the local public school with a full ride merit scholarship.<br/>\n<br/>\nUsing weighted scores is distorting, because that means every school is on a different scoring system. When scores are on different scales, they can neither be compared nor averaged. As a researcher who understands statistics, I can tell you that when I see a rating over 4.0 as a GPA, my initial thought is \"wow, that is a meaningless number\" rather than, \"wow, that is impressive\". I have never seen a single cogent explanation as to how weighting grades, such as adding one or two points for a course that is taught with a single minded purpose of passing an AP test, leads to a more accurate prediction of a college performance. compared to just using unweighted grades. Furthermore, there is such grade inflation in at most high schools, that even an unweighted 4.0 might indicate a hard-working, yet intellectually average, student. (This comes from direct experience, having taught at the college level extensively.) For example, I had one grad student who came in to our program with a 4.0 in high school and college -- never had a B in his life. He just could not learn statistics. I had to run all the stats for his masters thesis. In other academic areas he was mediocre. Not by any means a brilliant student, not a creative thinker, actually, not quick at all, but he sure was tenacious.<br/>\n<br/>\nLet's add discussion of the SATs. The SATs were \"recentered\" in the 1990's, because the test was bottom heavy (too few students were receiving high scores.) Then, the entire test was reconfigured a number of times. At this juncture, SATs have been watered down and inflated such that they are considerably easier then they were in the 1980's. Now, 1% of test takers score over a 1500 in a single sitting. If we add in superscores, we have (I speculate) over 2%, perhaps 3% with these scores over 1500. Some of those students are very good test takers, some are super-prepared, and some are truly brilliant. Some took the test multiple times to achieve an ideal score. So, how to distinguish them? CMU wants the innovators and thinkers -- not the grinds who take 300 practice tests. But how to find them? This is the challenge for the adcoms -- and no, taking your suggestion of doubling down on high test scores and high grades will not cut it. THIS is the reason for holistic admissions. Because the grinds who study their SAT book every night are not going to be the entrepreneurs of tomorrow. Someday they are just going to be better paid grinds in a 9-5 job -- like my 4.0 student mentioned above.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\nFinally, with your \"1390 SAT female taking the space of the [deserving] 1550 male\" statement, you are just inventing straw data to support your argument. I guess this is a common tactic in today's media, and so you are emulating what you see. So learn this lesson -- Made up numbers do not magically turn into data. Please point me to the actual data that demonstrates any single woman or group of women with a 1390 SAT took the \"space\" of a male (or group of males) with a 1590. I would like to see that... as I have read the common data set with some scrutiny and I cannot find any data to indicate that the quality of students has degraded since the university started to push towards gender equity.<br/>\n<br/>\nYou may think that if only you were female you might have gotten into a better college. But, given your argument style, that is probably incorrect. Your \"entitled\" attitude probably would have leaked out onto the essays, and you still would have had denials.<br/>\n<br/>\n</div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/21400302/#Comment_21400302\" name=\"Item_41\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2018-03-31T23:06:52+00:00\" title=\"March 31, 2018  7:06PM\">March 2018</time></a></span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">3</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2021579%2Fwomen-make-up-majority-of-carnegie-mellon-first-years%2Fp3\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=21400302\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

And courses in pre-med also get curved up, and have opportunities for easy extra credit!<br/>\n<br/>\n<a href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/profile/caz0743\" rel=\"nofollow\">@caz0743</a><br/>\n0) Was CMU your top choice school?<br/>\nWeird question people ask, it was one of my top choices, honestly when I applied I just wanted to go to college with a good reputation. I didn't really rank colleges until after I got in and CMU was #1 for me personally.<br/>\n<br/>\n1) Do you know CMU's placement rate into med. schools and which one's have you heard grads have gotten into?<br/>\nI think their placement rate is like 86% ? IDK, honestly it is pretty high. Lots of people go to UPitt (wonderful med school), UPenn, Mt Sinai, Albert Einstein, Drexel, Baylor, etc. Pretty good med schools.<br/>\n<br/>\n2) Do you feel that you are prepared or being prepared for the MCAT?<br/>\nEh, MCAT is a different beast to handle, however I think the classes in Chemistry is really top notch to be able to do Chem+Orgo+Biochem on the MCAT, and their Physics really go way beyond the MCAT if you ask me. I haven't checked out the biology section, and by taking reading intensive gened classes CARS would be decent to tackle. I think the pre-med courses are a strong foundation/starting point to study for MCAT.<br/>\n<br/>\n3) How difficult would a pre-med track be with BXA?<br/>\nBXA? Depends on the combination, but overall I think difficult because you essentially will be double majoring in another area which isn't STEM.<br/>\n<br/>\n4) Is there serious grade deflation(honestly) as you know top grades do get you into med school--it's reality (we know of a girl who was summa cum laude at another school and only got into 1of 8 schools!)<br/>\nYup, top grades get you into med school, I know someone who got into UPenn med and he wasn't a 4.0, had an meche GPA that was really good for engineering but pretty bad for medical school, BUT he pretty nailed the MCAT and is now in the top residency program for orthopedic surgery. I really really do think med school factor in your major and other things you achieved but his overall GPA was definitely at minimum a 3.5, science GPA higher than 3.5.<br/>\n<br/>\n5)I am interested in the above question as well... How hard is it to get A's in bio/chem/math classes if you study to your best ability and were a straight A kid in high school? Please be honest.<br/>\n<br/>\nI can't answer that. Like once again college is hard as heck. To be real compared to my CS courses I do think pre-med classes are extremely more straightforward if you throw yourself at the work. You can definitely get A's, it depends on how much you want it. I go to the extra tutoring stuff, and the people who lead the sessions work with the professor and typically tailor the practice packets to the exam &amp; HW's so I was able to score A's in those courses. Uh, people complain about how hard CMU is, but I think the pre-med courses are pretty manageable/bearable, like it doesn't feel like end of the world impossible (once again that is the CS courses). Like if you attend lectures, go to OH, stay engaged you are easily at a high B grade, just push a little more and bam at an A.<br/>\n<br/>\n<br/>\n6)Why or why not did or did you not consider University of Pittsburgh for pre-med? Might be a weird question but if you are local and I know CMU does collaborations with Pitt.<br/>\nUh, Pitt gave me really really shi**y FA, like the FA I got from CMU was 2X the COA at UPitt. So I think UPitt is an excellent education for pre-med too! I think a lot of schools are for pre-med, CMU has some really good tutoring services and I'm guessing UPitt would have good tutoring too since it is a bigger school. </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/22171621/#Comment_22171621\" name=\"Item_36\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2019-04-10T15:22:34+00:00\" title=\"April 10, 2019 11:22AM\">April 10</time></a></span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">0</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2094227%2Fwhy-not-to-go-to-cmu%2Fp2\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=22171621\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

You are right to think GPA is an issue- it is. But what people might not recognize is that struggling to get good grades impacts everything else as well. I was so busy trying to do well in my subjects that I couldn't study for the MCAT during the school year, which is what people in other schools do. I had to spend my entire summer on that. Med schools look for extracurriculars, clinical experience, shadowing, and other things that you will simply not have time for if you're trying to earn good grades at CMU. While CMU has a high med school placement, the kids here end up working a lot harder than they would at, say, a state school. Also, there's the fact that if you're planning to spend a ton of money on med school, why go to a private school for undergrad? I didn't know I was doing pre-med from the start, but if I had, I may not have gone here. I wouldn't know how the pre-health advising compares to other places, since CMU is the only place I've been, but I can tell you that we don't have a well-established program. The school devotes resources mostly towards graduate programs and research even within MCS. Overall, I would say it's a huge mistake to go to CMU for pre-med. </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/21657457/#Comment_21657457\" name=\"Item_2\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2018-08-05T19:20:38+00:00\" title=\"August  5, 2018  3:20PM\">August 2018</time></a></span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">0</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F2073628%2Fcmu-premed%2Fp1\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=21657457\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"

I am simply so surprised they even considered me at all? Do you know how many people are put on the priority waitlist versus the regular? Im gonna push really hard for them to accept me if theres space ill get my guidance counselor to call and tell them its my number one school (and complete the form by this morning). I'm actually happy even though its a waitlist because mellon is such a top ranked school and i thought they were so strict on grades like jhu so i thought they would just flat out reject me. would be great if you guys could lmk what my chances are from priority waitlist thanks!<br/>\n<br/>\nGPA and SAT stats:<br/>\nGPA: prob around a 90/91 out of 100.<br/>\nSAT: 2240<br/>\nMath SAT 2: 800<br/>\nBio M SAT 2: 700 (lol IK not good)<br/>\n<br/>\nEC's:<br/>\nVarsity public forum debate 4 years<br/>\nTutored inner city kids from Newark an hour a week on mathematics and science for their GED's (most dropped out of high school)<br/>\nCo-created a club for my high school called sounds for seniors, where we play music for senior citizens with dementia.<br/>\nBiggest selling point: I did research at Harvard University in psychology and helped design and pre-test a cognitive intervention for people with mild cognitive impairment that were most likely to develop AD from their initial diagnoses. I got my mentors to write recs so those probably helped a great deal. the sounds for seniors club I actually created specifically to help me emotionally connect with people who have the disease that I was studying and designing interventions for in the lab.<br/>\nVarsity lax.<br/>\n<br/>\nThere are a bunch of other things that I also put on my resume and application but I believe the ones stated above are the most noticeable and the ones I spent the most time on. What do you guys think? Pls let me know and you can be brutally honest lol. I will tell you that I did apply to Deitrich (if I didn't tell you already), so look at my stats and ecs in the context of that school.

He also had several civil rights internships where he was able to use his language skills. It may be difficult for CMU to find people with these strengths, who also have the quantitative chops to survive at CMU.<br/>\n<br/>\nStats: ACT 33 (34 superscore), GPA (not counting freshman year) perhaps 3.7 -- upward trend each year at private competitive school, SAT math 2 &gt; 750. It was to my son's great advantage that CMU drops freshman year from GPA calculation, since he had health issues that year which decreased his GPA.<br/>\n<br/>\nWe are in for some difficult decision making.<br/>\n<br/>\nThis may be the wrong place to ask, but can fellow Deitrich applicants share their impressions of this school? My son never visited. We are now trying to squeeze in a visit before decision time. </div>\n<div class=\"Meta Discussion DiscussionInfo\"><span class=\"MItem DateCreated\"><a class=\"Permalink\" href=\"/discussion/comment/20481845/#Comment_20481845\" name=\"Item_767\" rel=\"nofollow\"><time datetime=\"2017-03-28T03:14:28+00:00\" title=\"March 27, 2017 11:14PM\">March 2017</time></a></span></div><div class=\"Reactions\"><span class=\"Column-Score Hidden\">0</span><span class=\"ReactMenu\"><span class=\"ReactButtons\"> </span></span> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton ReactReply\" href=\"/entry/signin?Target=discussion%2F1903464%2Fcarnegie-mellon-class-of-2021-applicants-discussion-thread%2Fp39\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite SpReply\"></span> Reply</a> <span class=\"Bullet\">\u00b7</span> <a class=\"ReactButton PopupWindow\" href=\"https://talk.collegeconfidential.com/post/facebook/comment?id=20481845\" rel=\"nofollow\"><span aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"Sprite ReactSprite ReactFacebook\"></span><span class=\"sr-only\">Share</span></a></div> </div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</li>"
